      "\"254\" \"Peter Quill\" \"And I feel your pain, as well. I mean it’s not a competition, but I’ve been through a lot. My father killed my mother, then I had to kill my father.

      "\"280\" \"Thor\" \"There’s six stones out there. Thanos already has the Power Stone because he stole it last week, when he decimated Xandar. He stole the Space Stone from me when he destroyed my ship and slaughtered half my people. The Time and Mind Stones are safe on Earth. They’re with the Avengers.\"\n",

Therefore, Thanos can’t get it. Therefore, he’s going to Knowhere. Hence, he’ll be getting the Reality Stone. You’re welcome.\"\n",
      "\"285\" \"Gamora\" \"Then we have to go to Knowhere now.\"\n",
      "\"286\" \"Thor\" \"Wrong. Where we have to go, is Nivadellir.\"\n",

      "\"303\" \"Peter Quill\" \"Don’t you think that we should all have a weapon like that?\"\n",
      "\"304\" \"Thor\" \"No. You simply lack the strength to wield them. Your bodies will crumble as your minds collapse into the madness.\"\n",
      "\"305\" \"Rocket\" \"Is it weird that I wanna do it even more now?\"\n",
      "\"306\" \"Thor\" \"A little bit. Yeah.\"\n",

      "\"308\" \"Thor\" \"He already is.\"\n",
      "\"309\" \"Rocket\" \"I got it figured out. We got two ships, and a large assortment of morons. So me and Groot will go with the pirate-angel here, and the morons will go to Knowhere to try and stop Thanos. Cool? Cool.\"\n",
      "\"310\" \"Thor\" \"So cool.\"\n",
      "\"311\" \"Peter Quill\" \"For the record… I know that you’re only going with him because it’s where Thanos isn’t.\"\n",

      "\"486\" \"Okoye\" \"And what of this one?\"\n",
      "\"487\" \"T’Challa\" \"This one may be tired of war. but the White Wolf has rested long enough.\"\n",

      "\"489\" \"T’CHALLA\" \"On it’s way.\"\n",
      "\"490\" \"Ebony Maw\" \"In all the time I’ve served Thanos, I’ve never failed him. If I were to reach our rendezvous on Titan with the Time Stone still attatched to your vaguely irritating person, there would be…judgement. Give me… the stone.\"\n",
      "\"491\" \"TONY\" \"Wow you’re a seriously loyal piece of outerwear, aren’t you?\"\n",
      "\"492\" \"Peter Parker\" \"Yeah, uh, speaking of loyalty…\"\n",
      "\"493\" \"Tony\" \"What the-\"\n",
      "\"494\" \"Peter Parker\" \"I know what you’re gonna say.\"\n",
      "\"495\" \"Tony\" \"You should not be here.\"\n",
      "\"496\" \"Peter Parker\" \"I was gonna go home-\"\n",
      "\"497\" \"Tony\" \"I don’t wanna hear it.\"\n",
      "\"498\" \"Peter Parker\" \"But it was such a long way down and I just thought about you on the way-\"\n",
      "\"499\" \"Tony\" \"And now I gotta hear it.\"\n",
      "\"500\" \"Peter Parker\" \"…And I kinda stuck to the side of the ship. And this suit is ridiculously intuitive, by the way. So if anything, it’s kinda your fault that I’m here.\"\n",
      "\"501\" \"Tony\" \"What did you just say?\"\n",
      "\"502\" \"Peter Parker\" \"I take that back. And now I’m here in space.\"\n",
      "\"503\" \"Tony\" \"Yeah. Right where I don’t want you to be. This isn’t Coney Island. This isn’t a field trip. It’s one-way ticket. You hear me? Don’t pretend like you thought this through. You could not have possibly thought this through.\"\n",
      "\"504\" \"Peter Parker\" \"No. I did think this through.\"\n",
      "\"505\" \"Tony\" \"You could not have possibly thought this through.\"\n",
      "\"506\" \"Peter Parker\" \"It’s just- You can’t be a friendly neighborhood Spider – Man when there’s no neighborhood.  Okay. That didn’t really make any sense, but you know what I’m trying to say.\"\n",
      "\"507\" \"Tony\" \"Come on. We got a situation. See him down there? He’s in trouble. What’s your plan? Go.\"\n",
      "\"508\" \"Peter Parker\" \"Um. Okay. Okay…uh…did you ever see that really old movie, Aliens?\"\n",
      "\"509\" \"EBONY MAW\" \"Painful aren’t they? They were originally designed for microsurgery. And any one of them…\"\n",
      "\"510\" \"EBONY MAW\" \"…could end your friend’s life in an instant.\"\n",
      "\"511\" \"Tony\" \"I gotta tell you, he’s not really my friend. Saving his life is more a professional courtesy.\"\n",
      "\"512\" \"EBONY MAW\" \"You’ve saved nothing. Your powers are inconsequential compared to mine.\"\n",
      "\"513\" \"Tony\" \"Yeah, but the kid’s seen more movies.\"\n",
      "\"514\" \"Peter Parker\" \"Yes! Wait what are those!\"\n",
      "\"515\" \"Peter Parker\" \"Hey, we haven’t officially met.  Cool.\"\n",
      "\"516\" \"Strange\" \"We’ve gotta turn this ship around.\"\n",

      "\"518\" \"Strange\" \"No, I want to protect the stone.\"\n",

      "\"521\" \"Tony\" \"Who just saved your magical ass? Me.\"\n",
      "\"522\" \"Strange\" \"I seriously don’t know how you fit your head into that helmet.\"\n",
      "\"523\" \"Tony\" \"Admit it. You should have ducked out when I told you to. I tried to bench you. You refused.\"\n",
      "\"524\" \"Strange\" \"Unlike everyone else in your life, I don’t work for you.\"\n",
      "\"525\" \"Tony\" \"And due to that fact, we’re now in a flying doughnut billions of miles away from Earth with no backup.\"\n",
      "\"526\" \"Peter Parker\" \"I’m backup.\"\n",
      "\"527\" \"Tony\" \"No. You’re a stowaway. The adults are talking.\"\n",
      "\"528\" \"Strange\" \"I’m sorry, I’m confused as to the relationship here. What is he, your ward?\"\n",
      "\"529\" \"Peter Parker\" \"No. I’m peter, by the way.\"\n",
      "\"530\" \"Strange\" \"Doctor Strange.\"\n",
      "\"531\" \"Peter Parker\" \"Oh we’re using our made-up names. Um…I’m Spider-Man, then.\"\n",
      "\"532\" \"Tony\" \"This ship is self-correcting its course. Thing’s on autopilot.\"\n",
      "\"533\" \"Strange\" \"Can we control it? Fly us home?  Stark?\"\n",
      "\"534\" \"Tony\" \"Yeah.\"\n",
      "\"535\" \"Strange\" \"Can you get us home?\"\n",
      "\"536\" \"Tony\" \"Yeah I heard you. I’m thinking…I’m not so sure we should.\"\n",
      "\"537\" \"Strange\" \"Under no circumstance can we bring the Time Stone to Thanos. I don’t think you quite understand what’s at stake here.\"\n",
      "\"538\" \"Tony\" \"No. It’s you who doesn’t understand. Thanos has been inside my head for six years…Since he sent an army to New York and now he’s back! And I don’t know what to do. So I’m not so sure if it’s a better plan to fight him on out turf or his but you saw what they did, what he can do. At least on his turf, he’s not expecting it. So I say we take the fight to him. Doctor. Do you concur?\"\n",
      "\"539\" \"Strange\" \"Alright , Stark. We go to him. But you have to understand….if it comes to saving you or the kid or the Time Stone… I will not hesitate to let either of you die. I can’t, because the fate of the universe depends on it.\"\n",
      "\"540\" \"Tony\" \"Good. Nice. Moral compass.We’re straight.  Alright, kid. You’re an Avenger now.\"\n",
      "\"541\" \"Thanos\" \"I thought you might be hungry.\"\n",
      "\"542\" \"Gamora\" \"I always hated that chair.\"\n",
      "\"543\" \"Thanos\" \"So I’ve been told. Even so. I’d hoped you’d sit on it one day.\"\n",
      "\"544\" \"Gamora\" \"I hated this room. This ship. I hated my life.\"\n",
      "\"545\" \"Thanos\" \"You told me that too. Every day. For almost twenty years.\"\n",
      "\"546\" \"Gamora\" \"I was a child when you took me.\"\n",
      "\"547\" \"Thanos\" \"I saved you.\"\n",
      "\"548\" \"Gamora\" \"No. No. We were happy on my home planet.\"\n",
      "\"549\" \"Thanos\" \"Going to bed hungry. scrounging for scraps. Your planet was on the brink of collapse. I’m the one who stopped that. Do you know what’s happened since then? The children born have known nothing but full bellies and clear skies. It’s a paradise.\"\n",
      "\"550\" \"Gamora\" \"Because you murdered half the planet.\"\n",
      "\"551\" \"Thanos\" \"A small price to pay for salvation.\"\n",
      "\"552\" \"Gamora\" \"You’re insane.\"\n",
      "\"553\" \"Thanos\" \"Little one, it’s a simple calculus. This universe is finite, it’s resources finite. If life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist. It needs correction.\"\n",
      "\"554\" \"Gamora\" \"You don’t know that!\"\n",
      "\"555\" \"Thanos\" \"I’m the only one who knows that. At least, I’m the only one with the will to act on it. For a time…you had that same will…as you fought by my side. Daughter.\"\n",
      "\"556\" \"Gamora\" \"I’m not your daughter. Everything I hate about myself you taught me.\"\n",
      "\"557\" \"Thanos\" \"And in doing so, made you the fiercest woman in the galaxy. That’s why I trusted you to find the Soul Stone.\"\n",
      "\"558\" \"Gamora\" \"I’m sorry I disappointed you.\"\n",
      "\"559\" \"Thanos\" \"I am disappointed. But not because you didn’t find it. But because you did. And you lied.\"\n",
      "\"560\" \"Gamora\" \"Nebula.\"\n",
      "\"561\" \"Gamora\" \"Don’t do this.\"\n",
      "\"562\" \"Thanos\" \"Some time ago, your sister snuck aboard this ship to kill me.\"\n",
      "\"563\" \"Gamora\" \"Please don’t do this.\"\n",
      "\"564\" \"Thanos\" \"And very nearly succeded. So I brought her here. To talk.\"\n",
      "\"565\" \"Gamora\" \"Stop. Stop it. I swear to you on my life. I never found the Soul Stone.\"\n",
      "\"566\" \"Memory Nebula\" \"You know what he’s about to do. He’s finally ready, and he’s going for the stones. All of them.\"\n",
      "\"567\" \"Memory Gamora\" \"He can never get them all.\"\n",
      "\"568\" \"Memory Nebula\" \"He will!\"\n",
      "\"569\" \"Memory Gamora\" \"He can’t, Nebula. Because I found the map to the Soul stone and I burnt it to ash. I burnt it.\"\n",
      "\"570\" \"Thanos\" \"You’re strong. Me. You’re generous. Me. But I never taught you to lie. That’s why you’re so bad at it. Where is the Soul Stone?\"\n",
      "\"571\" \"Gamora\" \"Vormir!\"\n",
      "\"572\" \"Gamora\" \"The Soul Stone is on Vormir.\"\n",
      "\"573\" \"Thanos\" \"Show me.\"\n",
      "\"574\" \"Groot\" \"I am Groot.\"\n",
      "\"575\" \"Rocket\" \"Tinkle in the cup. We’re not looking. What’s there to see? What’s a twig? Everybody’s seen a twig.\"\n",
      "\"576\" \"Groot\" \"I am Groot.\"\n",
      "\"577\" \"Thor\" \"Tree, pour what’s in the cup out in space, and go in the cup again.\"\n",
      "\"578\" \"Rocket\" \"You speak Groot?\"\n",
      "\"579\" \"Thor\" \"Yes, they taught it on Asgard. It was an elective.\"\n",
      "\"580\" \"Groot\" \"I am Groot.\"\n",
      "\"581\" \"Thor\" \"You’ll know when we’re there. Nivadellir’s forge harnesses the power of a blazing neutron star.  It’s the birth place of my hammer. It’s truly awesome.\"\n",
      "\"582\" \"Rocket\" \"Okay, time to be the captain.  So, dead brother, huh? Yeah, that can be annoying.\"\n",
      "\"583\" \"Thor\" \"Well, he’s been dead before, but this time I think it really might be true.\"\n",
      "\"584\" \"Rocket\" \"And you said your sister and your dad?\"\n",
      "\"585\" \"Thor\" \"Both dead.\"\n",
      "\"586\" \"Rocket\" \"Still got a mom, though?\"\n",
      "\"587\" \"Thor\" \"Killed by a dark elf.\"\n",
      "\"588\" \"Rocket\" \"A best friend?\"\n",
      "\"589\" \"Thor\" \"Stabbed through the heart.\"\n",
      "\"590\" \"Rocket\" \"Are you sure you’re up to this particular murder mission?\"\n",
      "\"591\" \"Thor\" \"Absolutely. Rage, vengeance, anger, loss, regret…They’re all tremendous motivators. They really clear the mind. So I’m good to go.\"\n",
      "\"592\" \"Rocket\" \"Yeah, but this Thanos we’re talking about…He’s the toughest there is.\"\n",
      "\"593\" \"Thor\" \"Well, he’s never fought me.\"\n",
      "\"594\" \"Rocket\" \"Yeah, he has.\"\n",
      "\"595\" \"Thor\" \"He’s never fought me twice. And I’m getting a new hammer, don’t forget.\"\n",
      "\"596\" \"Rocket\" \"Better be some hammer.\"\n",
      "\"597\" \"Thor\" \"You know, I’m 1,500 years old. I’ve killed twice as many enemies as that, and every one would have rather killed me, but none succeeded. I’m only alive because fate wants me alive. Thanos is the latest in a long line of *morons* and he will be the latest to feel my vengeance.\"\n",
      "\"598\" \"Rocket\" \"And what if you’re wrong?\"\n",
      "\"599\" \"Thor\" \"If I’m wrong then what more could I lose?\"\n",
      "\"600\" \"Rocket\" \"I could lose a lot. Me personally. I could lose a lot.  Okay. If fate does want you to kill that crapsack… You’re gonna need more than one stupid eyeball.\"\n",
      "\"601\" \"Thor\" \"What’s this?\"\n",
      "\"602\" \"Rocket\" \"What’s it look like? Some jerk lost a bet with me on on Contraxia.\"\n",
      "\"603\" \"Thor\" \"He gave you his eye?\"\n",
      "\"604\" \"Rocket\" \"He gave me 100 credits. I snuck in later that night and stole his eye.\"\n",
      "\"605\" \"Thor\" \"Thank you, sweet rabbit.\"\n",
      "\"606\" \"Rocket\" \"Hmm. Huh? Oh. I would’ve washed that. The only way I could sneak it off Contraxia was up my…Hey, we’re here!\"\n",
      "\"607\" \"Thor\" \"I don’t think this thing works. Everything seems dark.\"\n",
      "\"608\" \"Rocket\" \"It ain’t the eye.\"\n",
      "\"609\" \"Thor\" \"Something’s wrong. The star’s gone out. And the rings are frozen.\"\n",
      "\"610\" \"Rocket\" \"I hope these dwarves are better at forging than they are cleaning…Maybe they realized they live in a junk pile in the middle of space…\"\n",
      "\"611\" \"Thor\" \"This forge hasn’t gone dark in centuries…\"\n",
      "\"612\" \"Rocket\" \"You said Thanos had a gauntlet, right?\"\n",
      "\"613\" \"Thor\" \"Yes. Why?\"\n",
      "\"614\" \"Rocket\" \"Look anything like that?\"\n",
      "\"615\" \"Groot\" \"I am Groot.\"\n",
      "\"616\" \"Rocket\" \"Go back to the pod.\"\n",

      "\"621\" \"Thor\" \"Asgard is destroyed. Eitri, the glove. What did you do?\"\n",
      "\"622\" \"Eitri\" \"300 dwarves lived on this ring. I thought if I did what he asked, they’d be safe. I made what he wanted. A device capable of harnessing the power of the stones. Then he killed everyone anyway. All except me. “Your life is yours.” he said “But your hands are mine alone.”\"\n",
      "\"623\" \"Thor\" \"Eitri, this isn’t about your hands. Every weapon you’ve designed, every axe, hammer sword…It’s all inside your head. Now I know all hope feels lost. Trust me, I know. But together, you and I, we can kill Thanos.\"\n",
      "\"624\" \"Nebula\" \"Mantis, listen very carefully. I need you to meet me on Titan.\"\n",
      "\"625\" \"Peter Parker\" \"Hey, what’s going on?\"\n",
      "\"626\" \"Tony\" \"I think we’re here. I don’t think this rig has a self-park function.  Get your hand into this steering gimbal. Close those around it. You understand?\"\n",

      "\"628\" \"Tony\" \"This was meant for one big guy, so we gotta to move at the same time.\"\n",

      "\"663\" \"Rocket\" \"This is plan? We’re gonna hit him with a brick?\"\n",
      "\"664\" \"Eitri\" \"It’s a mold. A king’s weapon. Meant to be the greatest in Asgard. In theory, it could even summon the Bifrost.\"\n",

      "\"673\" \"Tony\" \"Are you yawning? In the middle of this, while I’m breaking it down? Huh? Did you hear what I said?\"\n",

Text mining, also known as text analytics, is the process of converting unstructured, free text into normalized, structured data that can be analyzed. Text mining identifies facts, relationships and assertions that would otherwise remain unidentified in the textual big data. Understanding text is a key feature of some of the prominent machine learning models such as emotion/sentiment detection, smart compose, and smart reply. \n",

On the first read, they try to get a sense of the story. On the second read, they try to focus on their character specifically. To get yourself in the mindset of your character, you need to analyze the script in order to figure out the important topics of the film, emotions and actions you should convey when reading your lines, and interactions with other characters. However, your role was given to you on short notice so you do not have a lot of time to prepare. In order to speed up the process of understanding your role, you decided to use text mining.\n",

Before it clears, Iron Man pile drives into Thanos horizontally, using his single super-jet boot configuration. As he bounces off, he flips and sticks his landing, immediately re-configuring his boots into ground clamps for stability and his gloves into rocket-driven battering rams, punching Thanos into a ruined wall behind him.\"\n",

The Titan makes use of the fractional delay and punches back hard, sending Iron Man sliding meters away, giving Thanos time to rip the brace device off the gauntlet. He immediately uses the Power Stone to stream furiously lambent energy at his opponent, who forms a shield to kneel behind just as instantly, getting pushed back even further by the incredible force.\"\n",
      "\"1215\" \"None\" \"Iron Man slides out from behind the shield, letting the angled energy push him away for a faster start, and whips back to Thanos full thrusters; he kicks at the Titan with his left foot, turning the boot into a ground clamp at the same time to pin the gauntlet, and keeps twisting while his left glove becomes a ram again, slamming into Thanos' face, cutting his cheek.\"\n",

Iron Man attempts to block the blows with his forearms, but Thanos is relentless, picking him up by the helmet and blasting his midsection with the Power Stone. The gaps in nanite coverage are now gaping, as the armor loses the ability to recover from the intensity and extent of the damage. Iron Man lands hard from the Power blast, struggles to one knee and fires his right hand repulsor at the inexorable Thanos; the beam is easily deflected by the gauntlet. He gets to both feet as the suit tries to complete repairs, adding the beam from his left hand as well. Thanos walks right up to him, and backhands the incomplete helmet completely off Tony's head. He crosses his arms to block a blow from Thanos' gauntlet, and has his left hand caught over his head. In desperation, he forms what's left of his right glove into a short-sword, which is also easily caught by Thanos, snapping it off clean and driving it through Tony's left side.

    "Now that we have structured the data, we can apply preprocessing techniques. Preprocessing refers to the technique of preparing (cleaning and organizing) the raw data to make it suitable for analysis. In terms of natural language processing, text preprocessing is the practice of cleaning and preparing text data. This is important because it transforms the text into a more digestable form for analysis. Without preprocessing, the data could be very inconsistent and generate bad analytical results. Text preprocessing can be broken down into 3 generic concepts:\n",
    "    - Noise removal -> Stripping the text of formatting \n",
    "    - Normalization -> Reformating textual content\n",
    "    - Tokenization -> Breaking up text into tokens\n",
    " \n",
    "Since we want to be able to quickly and efficiently embody our character, we must acquire the relevant information that can help us prepare for our role. Text preprocessing enables us to extract important information from text, which allows us to better understand the natural language. \n",

      "Marvel Opening Credits Radio transmission sound The Marvel Studios Logo plays as usual but this time, at the end of that logo, the background changes from red to black and the I and O in Studios become 10 in red. The logo now reads Marvel Stud10s. Throughout the logo, an Asgardian is reporting a distress signal. This is the Asgardian refugee vessel Statesman. We are under assault, I repeat, we are under assault - The engines are dead, life support failing. Requesting aid from any vessel within range. We are 22 jump points out of Asgard.  Our crew is made up of Asgardian families, we have very few soldiers here. This is not a warcraft. I repeat, this is not a warcraft! Inside the ship, Ebony Maw walks among the bodies of dead Asgardians. Heimdall, badly wounded, reaches out as if he would stop Maw as he passes, but lacks the strength. Maw steps over them with no mind as he speaks, as if they were scattered pieces of dirty clothing on a bedroom floor. Hear me, and rejoice. You have had the privilege of being saved by the Great Titan.... You may think this is suffering... no. It is salvation. Universal scales tip toward balance because of your sacrifice. Smile...  for even in death, you have become Children of Thanos. Loki stands with the Black Order. He watches Thanos, shrouded in darkness and light, a vague silhouette. I know what it's like to lose. To feel so desperately that you're right... yet to fail, nonetheless.  It's frightening. Turns the legs to jelly. I ask you, to what end? Dread it. Run from it. Destiny arrives all the same. And now, it's here. Or should I say...i am. Thanos holds up his hand to reveal the Infinity Gauntlet, which already hosts the violet Power Stone. You talk too much. The Tesseract, or your brother's head. I assume you have a preference. The Black Order heft their weapons or smirks, as appropriate. Oh, I do. Kill away! Thanos' face expresses surprise briefly before presses the gauntlet to Thor's left temple. The Power Stone glows brightly. Thor screams hoarsely. ALL RIGHT, STOP! We don't have the Tesseract. It was destroyed on Asgard. Loki glances at Thor like he knows something he doesn't. He lifts his right hand into the air and the Tesseract reveals itself. You really are the worst brother. I assure you, brother... the sun will shine on us again. Your optimism is misplaced, Asgardian. Well, for one thing, I'm not Asgardian. And for another... we have a Hulk. Thanos looks to his right just as a green and very angry mass slams into him. Loki dives for Thor, pulling both of them out of the way as the Tesseract skitters across the floor, and the Hulk charges Thanos. The Hulk pummels Thanos, forcing him backwards and shoving him into the wall of the ship. Maw stops Cull Obsidian from interfering. Let him have his fun. Thanos pries the Hulk's hands away; an expression of surprise and fear crosses his green face. After several hard blows, Thanos picks up the Hulk and slams him to the deck, defeated. Thor slams a metal bar across Thanos' back to no avail, is kicked across the deck by Thanos and is promptly bound in metal debris by Ebony Maw to keep him from interfering further. Allfathers… let the dark magic flow through me one last... time. Heimdall summons the Bifrost, which carries the Hulk away; he meets Thor's eye. That was a mistake. Thanos borrows Corvus's glaive and stabs Heimdall through the heart, twisting the blade in the wound. NO!!!  You're going to die for that! Shh. My humble personage… bows before your grandeur. No other being has ever had the might, nay the nobility, to wield not one, but two Infinity Stones. The universe lies within your grasp. Thanos crushes the Tesseract, revealing the blue Space Stone. He blows some of the fractals away, fingering the Stone between his thumb and index, before placing it on the gauntlet, and is momentarily rocked by the surge of energy that pulses as the stone seats in its setting. There are two more Stones on Earth. Find them, my children, and bring them to me on Titan. Father, we will not fail you. If I might interject… if you're going to Earth, you might want a guide. I do have a bit of experience in that arena. If you consider failure experience. I consider experience, experience. Almighty Thanos, I... Loki... Prince of Asgard...  Odinson... the rightful King of Jotunheim... God of Mischief... do hereby pledge to you, my undying fidelity. Thor squints and notices a dagger materialize in Loki's hand. Loki braces himself, thrusts upward with lightning speed and attempts to stab Thanos, but is frozen in place by the Space Stone's power before the point could strike home. Undying? You should choose your words more carefully. Thanos twists the dagger out of Loki's hand with his right hand, then takes hold of Loki's neck with the gauntlet and lifts him to eye level. Loki struggles, kicking, as his throat is squeezed. He makes eye contact with Thor before he increases his force on Loki's neck. You will... never be... a god. NO! No resurrections this time. Thanos raises the gauntlet, sends violet Power fire through the remains of the Statesman, and uses the Space Stone to teleport away with the Black Order. No… Loki…. Thor is released from his bonds. He crawls over to Loki's body -- which, unlike in The Dark World, has not returned to its Jotun form -- and lays his head down on Loki's chest, shedding tears for all that he has lost. The ship explodes. The Bifrost continues its journey, bringing the Hulk across space to Earth. Sanctum Sanctorum, New York City Doctor Strange, Master of the Mystic Arts, proceeds down the main steps of the Sanctum with Wong. Seriously? You don't have any money? Attachment to the material is detachment from the spiritual. I'll tell the guys at the deli.  Maybe they'll make you a metaphysical ham on rye. Oh, wait, wait, wait, I think I have 200. Dollars? Rupees. Which is? Uh, buck and a half. What do you want? I wouldn't say no to a tuna melt. Bruce crash-lands through the Sanctum stairs. The Cloak of Levitation swirls around Strange's shoulders immediately. Thanos is coming. He's coming... Who? Title Screen: Avengers: Infinity War Public Park, New York City, day. Tony Stark and Pepper Potts walk on having a conversation. Slow down, slow down. I'm totally not kidding. You're totally rambling. No, I'm not. Lost me. Look, you know how you're having a dream, and in the dream you gotta pee? Yeah. Okay, and then you're like, 'Oh my god, there's no bathroom, what am I gonna do?', 'Oh! Someone's watching,' ''m gonna go in my pants.' Right. And then you wake up, and in real life you actually have to pee. Yes. Yeah. Everybody has that. Right! That's the point I'm trying to make. Apropos of that, last night, I dreamt, we had a kid. So real. We named him after your eccentric uncle. Uh, what was his name? Right. Morgan! Morgan. So you woke up, and thought that we were... Expecting. Yeah. Yes? No. I had a dream about it. It was so real. If you wanted to have a kid, you wouldn't have done that. Pepper unties his jacket sleeves and taps Tony's chest attachment. I'm glad you brought this up, 'cause it's nothing. It's just a housing unit for nano particles. It's not helping your case, OK? No, no, it's an attachment, it's not a- You don't need that. I know. I had the surgery. I'm just trying to protect us. The future uses, and that's it. Just in case there's a monster in the closet, instead of, you know... Shirts? You know me so well. You finish all my sentences. You should have shirts in your closet. Yeah. You know what there should be? No more surprises. We're gonna have a nice dinner tonight. Show off this Harry Win-stone. Right? And we should have no more surprises. Ever. I should promise you. Yes. I will. Tony kisses Pepper. Doctor Strange comes through a portal. Tony Stark, I'm Doctor Stephen Strange. I need you to come with me. Oh, uh, congratulations on the wedding, by the way. Tony and Pepper are understandably shocked. I'm sorry, you giving out tickets or something? We need your help. Look, it's not overselling to say that the fate of the universe is at stake. And who's we? Hey, Tony. Bruce. Pepper. Hi. You okay? Bruce gives Tony a desperate hug, not answering. After everything he has been through, we understand. Back at the Sanctum Sanctorum. From the dawn of the universe, there was nothing. Then, boom! The Big Bang sent six elemental crystals, hurtling across the virgin universe. These Infinity Stones each control an essential aspect of existence. Space. Reality. Power. Soul. Mind. And Time. Dr. Strange opens the Eye of Agamotto, revealing the Time Stone emitting emerald light. Tell me his name again. Thanos. He's a plague, Tony. He invades planets. He takes what he wants. He wipes out half the population. He sent Loki. The attack on New York. That's him. This is it... What's our timeline? No telling. He has the Power and Space Stones, that already makes him the strongest creature in the whole universe. If he gets his hands, on all six Stones, Tony... He can destroy life on a scale hitherto undreamt of. Did you seriously just say hitherto undreamt of? Are you seriously leaning on the Cauldron of the Cosmos? Is that what this is.... ? The Cloak of Levitation smacks Tony's arm, surprising him. I'm going to allow that. If Thanos needs all six, why don't we just stick this one down the garbage disposal? No can do. We swore an oath to protect the Time Stone. With our lives. And I swore off dairy, but then, Ben & Jerry's named a flavor after me, so.... Stark Raving Hazelnuts. It's not bad. A bit chalky. A Hunka-Hulka Burning Fudge is our favorite. That's a thing? Whatever. Point is: things change. Our oath to protect the Time Stone cannot change. This Stone may be the best chance we have against Thanos. And still conversely, it may also be his best chance against us. Well, if we don't do our jobs. What is your job exactly, besides making balloon animals? Protecting your reality, douchebag. You seriously can't tell who's sarcasm is better. Okay, guys, could we table this discussion right now? The fact is that we have this Stone. We know where it is. Vision is out there somewhere with the Mind Stone, and we have to find him now. Yeah, that's the... thing. What do you mean? Two weeks ago, Vision turned off his transponder. He's offline. What? Tony, you lost another super bot? I didn't lose him. He's more than that. He's evolving. Who could find Vision, then? Shit.  Probably Steve Rogers. Oh, great. Maybe. But... Call him. It's not that easy. God, we haven't caught up in a spell, have we? No. The Avengers broke up. We're toast. Broke up? Like a band? Like The Beatles? Cap and I fell out hard. We're not on speaking terms. Tony, listen to me. Thor's gone. Thanos is coming. It doesn't matter who you're talking to or not. Tony hesitates, before pulling out the cellular phone Steve mailed him, muttering 'flip phone'. It seems as though he brings it everywhere, always ready to call his lost friend. Before clicking Call, he pauses, distracted by an unusual rumbling. Say, Doc, you wouldn't happen to be moving your hair, would you? Not at the moment, no. Tony looks at the Hulk-made opening through the ceiling and sees debris flying by outside. He exits the Sanctum through the front door and scans the chaotic surroundings, the camera shaking around in this following long take to illustrate the chaos -- people running and screaming in alarm, traffic becoming impossibly tangled, a litter-filled wind like a nor'easter's. A woman falls nearly at his feet and he helps her up. You okay? The woman ignores him and runs away. A car crashes in on a pole behind Tony. Help him! Wong, Doc. Go! Got it! F.R.I.D.A.Y., what am I looking at? Not sure, I'm working on it. Hey! You might wanna put that Time Stone in your back pocket, Doc! Might wanna use it. A mechanical hum grows louder as Tony approaches the intersection. As he turns the corner, he sees a huge circular ship floating over Bleecker Street. On a school bus, the hairs on Peter Parker's arms stand up. He looks out the window and sees the ship. Ned, hey. I need you to cause a distraction. Holy shit! We're all gonna die! There's a spaceship! Students scramble to the windows in the back to see the spaceship. Peter quickly slides on one of his Stark-made webshooters, and webs the emergency exit lever on the opposite side of the bus. What's the matter with you kids? You've never seen a spaceship before? Peter jumps out the window, clinging to the side of the bus and pulling on his mask before leaping over the side of the bridge, shooting a web-line and swinging free. He makes his way hastily towards the ship. F.R.I.D.A.Y., evac anyone south of 43rd Street, notify first responders. Will do. Doctor Strange throws the Winds of Watoomb over Bleeker Street, and winks at Tony. The dust clears. Tony is begrudgingly amused for a split second. Then Ebony Maw and Cull Obsidian exit the ship by transmat. Hear me, and rejoice. You are about to die at the hands of the Children of Thanos. Be thankful, that your meaningless lives are now contributing to- I'm sorry, Earth is closed today! You better pack it up and get outta here. Stonekeeper...  Does this chattering animal speak for you? Certainly not. I speak for myself.  But you’re trespassing in this city and on this planet. It means get lost, Squidward! He exhausts me. Bring me the Stone. Banner, you want a piece? No, not really, but when do I ever get what I want? That's right. Bruce attempts to release the Hulk. Instead of Hulk coming out easily, the most that turns green is Bruce's neck. Been a while. Good to have you, buddy. I just... I need to concentrate here for one second. Come on, come on, man. Where's your guy? I don't know. We've sorta been havin' a thing. There's no time for a thing. I know. That's the thing right there. Let's go. Bruce gives out a loud grunt, but fails to release the Hulk. Doctor Strange stares at Tony and Bruce in disbelief. Dude, you're embarrassing me in front of the wizards. Tony, I'm sorry.  Either I can't or he won't-- It's okay. Hey, stand down.  Keep an eye on him. Thank you. I have him. Damn it. As Cull Obsidian approaches the team, Tony dons his nanotech Iron Man suit in the space of three steps. He grows a shield on one arm to protect himself, then grows a set of blasters that easily throw the Dwarf back to Maw, who gestures and deflects his massive companion into some cars. Where'd that come from? It's nano-tech. You like it? A little someth-- Ebony Maw creates a spike of earth that throws Iron Man far up, and attacks the rest of the team with uprooted trees and other debris. Wong summons the Shield of the Seraphim. Dr. Banner, if the rest of your green friend won't be joining us.... Doctor Strange teleports Bruce to a nearby park along with half a taxi. Iron Man returns and joins the fight, pushing a car thrown by Maw back at him. Maw cuts it in half and lets the pieces fly past him, untouched. Gotta get that stone outta here, now. It stays with me. Exactly. Bye. Iron Man flies through Ebony Maw's obstacle course but is cut short by Cull Obsidian's hammer, sending him through a building and into the park at high speed, plowing into the ground and fetching up against a tree. Tony, you okay? How we doing? Good? Bad? Really, really good. Really good. Do you plan on helping out? I'm trying. He won't come out. Cull Obsidian arrives at the park and throws his hammer at Bruce and Iron Man. Hammer. Iron Man's energy beam deflects off Cull Obsidian's shield, slicing down trees. Bruce barely evades one. Come on, Hulk. What are you doing to me?  Come out! Come out! Come out! Nooooooo! Bruce falls back exhausted into his tree. What do you mean, no?! Iron Man is knocked down by Obsidian, who is about to deliver a decisive blow, but the alien's hammer is easily caught by Spider-Man. Hey, man. What's up, Mr. Stark? Kid, where'd you come from? Field trip to MoMA. Cull Obsidian grabs Spider-Man and throws him away. What is this guy's problem, Mr. Stark? He's from space. He came here to steal a necklace from a wizard. Wong and Doctor Strange fight Maw. Maw lifts several bricks from the ground and turns them into sharp points. He sends them towards Wong and Doctor Strange. The two make portals and boomerang them back towards Maw. Maw moves a car to protect himself, but one spike still hits his head, creating a cut. Angered, Maw uses a broken fire hydrant's water stream to knock Wong back several meters, rendering him unconscious. Doctor Strange snaps a whip of magical energy to bind Maw's hands and yanks, but Maw flies forward with the pull and pins Doctor Strange upside-down against a building, using the bricks to trap the Sorcerer Supreme. Your powers are quaint. You must be popular with children. Maw tries to grab the amulet holding the Time Stone but jerks back when it burns his hand. It's a simple spell but quite unbreakable. Then I'll take it off your corpse. Maw pulls Doctor Strange away from the building and throws him to the ground. Doctor Strange starts the gestures to use the Eye of Agamotto, but utility cables first pin Doctor Strange's arms, interrupting the spell and closing the Eye, while another cable winds around his torso, then tightens around his throat. You'll find... removing a dead man's spell... troublesome. You'll only wish you were dead.  NO! Kid, that's the wizard. Get on it. On it! Spider-Man chases Ebony Maw, floating speedily and upright on a small platform of burbling debris leaving a deep rut in the streets, who in turn chases the Cloak-driven Doctor Strange through Manhattan; Maw attacks him, throwing a Rocket Mortgage billboard at Spider-Man to be rid of him. Not cool! Maw bends all the utility poles in the path of the fleeing Cloak, finally snagging the loyal garment and ripping it loose of its master. Spider-Man scoops up Doctor Strange before he hits the pavement, but before he can get away with the unconscious Doctor Strange, a cone of blue light starts pulling the mage inexorably upwards. Spider-Man grabs a light pole to anchor himself, but Maw uproots it, sending Doctor Strange, Cloak and teenager on their way to his ship. Uhhh, Mr. Stark? I'm being beamed up! Hang on, kid. Wong, you're invited to my wedding.  Give me a little juice, F.R.I.D.A.Y. Ebony Maw walks towards the controls of the ship, Doctor Strange's unconscious body floating face-down behind him, and prepares to leave Earth's atmosphere. Unlock 17-A.  Pete, you gotta let go. I'm gonna catch you. But you said save the wizard!  I can't breathe! You're too high up. You're running out of air. Yeah! That makes sense. Peter passes out, free-falling, but not for long before the pod reaches him. It attaches itself to him, becoming the Iron Spider suit. Now being able to breathe, Spider-Man lands on a bottom part of the ship, standing up heroically. Mr. Stark, it smells like a new car in here! Happy trails, kid. F.R.I.D.A.Y, send him home. Yep. A large parachute extends from the new suit, snatching Spider-Man free of the ship's hull and him spiraling back to Earth. OH, COME ON! Iron Man latches onto the hull and cuts a hole to board the ship, looking for wherever Strange and Ebony Maw went. Boss, incoming call from Miss Potts. Tony? Oh, my God. Are you all right? What's going on? Yeah, I'm fine. I just think we might have to push our 8:30 res. Why? Just 'cause I'll... probably not make it back for a while. Tell me you're not on that ship. Yeah. God, no. Please tell me you're not on that ship. Honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I don't know what to say. Come back here, Tony. I swear to God…. Pep…. Come back here right now! Come back! Boss, we're losing her. I'm going, too…. Spider-Man is revealed to have managed to shoot a web to the outside of the ship, foiling his parachute, and clambers inside a slowly-closing chamber. Oh my God!  I should have stayed on the bus.... Ebony Maw, hands engaged in the ship's steering mechanism, accelerates into hyperspace. Meanwhile, back in New York Bruce finds Tony's flip-phone in the debris on the street and picks it up thoughtfully. Wong opens up a portal back to the Sanctum. Where you going? The Time Stone's been taken. The Sanctum remains unguarded. What will you do? I'm gonna make a call. Wong nods in understanding and closes the portal, not to be seen again for the rest of the movie. Banner holds Steve Rogers' cell phone and makes a call. Screen title: SPACE Camera pans around a brightly colored planet with ice rings to the Benatar. The Guardians of the Galaxy are travelling to investigate a distress call to the tune of Rubberband Man. Sing it, Drax! Drax is snoring with his mouth open from his seat in front of Quill. Gamora lip-syncs with the song along with Quill. Why are we doing this again? It's a distress signal, Rocket. Someone could be dying. I get that, but why are we doing it? 'Cause we're nice. And maybe whoever it is will give us a little cheddar cheese  for our help. Which isn't the point. Which isn't the point... I mean… if he doesn't pony up…. We'll take his ship. Exactly! B-b-b-bingo! Gamora looks up at Quill in concern. Quill returns her look and grimaces a don't worry about it expression at her. We are arriving. All right, Guardians. Don't forget, this might be dangerous, so let's put on our mean faces.  Groot, put that thing away. Now. I don't wanna tell you again.  Groot. I am Groot! Whoa! Language! Hey! Wow. You got some acorns on you, kid. Ever since you got a little sap, you're a total d-hole. Keep it up, and I'm gonna SMASH THAT THING TO PIECES! Groot rolls his eyes. The Benatar decelerates, and Thanos' devastation suddenly covers the Guardians' field of view, revealing the distress signal to be the one from the Asgardian vessel at the beginning of the movie. Bodies are seen floating dead in space along with the pieces of the shredded ship. What happened? Looks like we're not getting paid. With a thump, Thor's body is plastered to the hull of the ship. Wipers! Wipers! Get it off! Thor’s eye opens; all gasp. Cut to the Guardians settling the still-unconscious Thor onto an examination table. How the hell is this dude still alive? He is not a dude. You're a dude. This... this is a man. A handsome, muscular man. I'm muscular. Who are you kidding, Quill? You're one sandwich away from fat. Yeah, right. It's true. You have gained a little weight…. Gamora leaves Quill's side at Thor's right, and circles around the foot of the table. What? Gamora, do you think I'm… He is anxious. Angry. He feels tremendous loss and guilt. It's like a pirate had a baby with an angel. Wow. This is a real wake-up call for me. Okay. I'm gonna get a Bow-flex. I'm gonna commit. I'm gonna get some dumbbells. You know you can't eat dumbbells, right? It's like his muscles are made of Cotati metal fibers. Stop massaging his muscles.  Wake him up. Wake. Thor awakens, sitting up violently and throwing himself off the table to stumble a few steps away, then turning to see his hosts all pointing their weapons of choice at him; Groot is still playing his game. Who the hell are you guys? Cut to later as the Guardians stand around Thor eating soup. The entire time I knew Thanos, he only ever had one goal: To bring balance to the Universe by wiping out half of all life. He used to kill people planet by planet, massacre by massacre.... Including my own. If he gets all six Infinity Stones, he can do it with the snap of his fingers, like this. You seem to know a great deal about Thanos. Gamora... is the daughter of Thanos. Your father killed my brother. Oh, boy. Stepfather. Technically, she hates him as much as you do. Families can be tough.  Before my father died, he told me I had a half-sister... that he imprisoned in Hel. Then she returned home, and stabbed me in the eye, so... I had to kill her. It's life, isn't it, I guess. Goes round and round and... I feel your pain. Peter glares at Thor's hand on Gamora's shoulder, on the verge of full snarl, and moves around her to push between her and Thor. And I feel your pain, as well. I mean it's not a competition, but I've been through a lot. My father killed my mother, then I had to kill my father. And that was hard. Probably even harder than having to kill a sister. Plus, I, came out of it with both of my eyes-- I need a hammer, not a spoon….  How do I open this thing? Is there some sort of a four-digit code maybe… maybe a birth date or something…. What are you doing? Taking your pod. No, you're not!  You'll not, be taking our pod today, sir. Quill. Are you making your voice deeper? No. You are. You're imitating the god-man. It's weird. No I'm not. He just did it again! This is my voice! Are you mocking me? Are you mocking me? Stop it. You did it again. He's trying to copy me. Would you stop doing that? He's doing it first. Enough! We need to stop Thanos. Which means we need to find out where he's going next. Knowhere. He must be going somewhere. No. Knowhere? It's a place. We've been there. It sucks. Excuse me, that's our food. Not anymore. Thor… why would he go to Knowhere? Because for years, the Reality Stone has been safely stored, there with a man we call the Collector. If it's with the Collector, then it's not safe. Only an idiot would give that man a stone. Or a genius. How do you know he's not going for one of the other Stones? There's six stones out there.  Thanos already has the Power Stone because he stole it last week, when he decimated Xandar. He stole the Space Stone from me when he destroyed my ship and slaughtered half my people. The Time and Mind Stones are safe on Earth. They're with the Avengers. The 'Avengers'? Earth's Mightiest Heroes. Like Kevin Bacon? He may be on the team. I don't know. Haven't been there in a while. As for the Soul Stone, well, no one's ever seen that. No one even knows where it is. Therefore, Thanos can't get it. Therefore, he's going to Knowhere. Hence, he'll be getting the Reality Stone. You're welcome. Then we have to go to Knowhere now. Wrong! Where we have to go, is Nivadellir. That's a made up word. All words are made up. It's official: mind blown. Hold up, Nidavellir is real?  Seriously? I mean, that place is a legend.  They make the most powerful, horrific weapons to ever torment the Universe. I would very much like to go there, please. The rabbit is correct, and clearly the smartest among you. Rabbit? Only Eitri the dwarf king can make me the weapon I need.  I assume you're the captain, sir? You're very perceptive. You seem like a noble leader. Will you join me on my quest to Nidavellir? Lemme just ask the captain. Oh, wait a second, it's me! Yeah, I'll go. Wonderful. Except for that I'm the captain. Quiet! That's my backpack. Go sit down. Look, this is my ship. And I'm not goin' to…  Wait, what kind of weapon are we talking about here? The Thanos killing kind. Don't you think that we should all have a weapon like that? No. You simply lack the strength to wield them. Your bodies will crumble as your minds collapse into the madness. Is it weird that I wanna do it even more now? A little bit. Yeah. If we don't go to Knowhere and Thanos retrieves another stone, he'll be too powerful to stop. He already is. I got it figured out. We got two ships, and a large assortment of morons. So me and Groot will go with the pirate-angel here, and the morons will go to Knowhere to try and stop Thanos. Cool? Cool. So cool. For the record… I know that you're only going with him because it's where Thanos isn't. You know, you shouldn't talk that way to your captain, Quill.  Come on, Groot. Put that game down, you'll rot your brain. I bid you farewell and good luck, morons. Bye. The Guardians nod or wave farewell as Thor, Rocket and Groot depart. Cut to Scotland, where Vision and Wanda Maximoff are sharing a room. Wanda is in bed while Vision, in a human glamour, watches out a window. High-pitched trilling Vis? Is it the stone again? It's as if it's speaking to me. What does it say? I don't... I don't know. But something... The stone trills again and Vision flinches. Wanda takes his face in her hands. Vision turns his head so he can kiss her left palm, then presses Wanda's hand to the Mind Stone. Tell me what you feel. Wanda gestures, her hand emanating her red swirling energy. She seems confused. I just feel you. They kiss. Cut to later, where the two are going on a stroll. So there's a 10 AM to Glasgow to give us more time together before you went back. What if I miss that train? There is an 11. What if I missed all the trains? What if this time, I didn't go back? You gave Stark your word. I'd rather give it to you. There are people who are expecting me too, you know. We both made promises. Not to each other.  Wanda… for two years, we've stolen these moments, trying to see if this could work. And... I don't know.  You know what, I'm just gonna speak for myself -- I, I... I think... It works. It works. Then stay. Stay with me. Wanda looks down, but then her eyes and attention drift to her left. Or not. If I'm overstepping… Wanda steps over to a better view of the TV in the kebab shop at which they had stopped, drawing Vision with her. It shows coverage of the invasion of New York, the alien antagonists, and the disappearance of Tony Stark. What are they? What the stone was warning me about.  I have to go. No, Vision. Vision, if that's true… then maybe going isn't the best idea. Wanda...I- Corvus Glaive suddenly appears behind Vision and stabs him through the back. Vision screams, loses his glamour to return to his green, red and gold appearance, and is thrown down into the street. Vision! Corvus Glaive pins Vision down and digs the point of his high-tech glaive into Vision's forehead in an attempt to extract the Mind Stone. The Scarlet Witch commits her own surprise attack, blasts both of the aliens away, then lifts Vision and herself into a nearby courtyard, from where the Scarlet Witch drags him to rest in a concealed alleyway. The blade. It stopped me from phasing. Is that even possible? It isn't supposed to be.  My systems are failing.  I'm beginning to think... we should have stayed in bed. Corvus Glaive suddenly arrives, knocking the Scarlet aside and grabbing Vision into the air, Vis! Corvus flies away with Vision, slamming him against several walls. Meanwhile, Proxima engages the Scarlet Witch with her staff weapon and they too begin to fight. Give up the Stone, and she lives. Vision flies with Corvus to the roof of what appears to be a church, ricocheting off the stone church tower and onto the metal-clad roof. Simultaneously, Proxima and the Scarlet Witch fight below, staff weapon versus magic energy hands until Proxima uses the blaster effect of her weapon to knock the Scarlet Witch meters away, stunning her as Proxima leaps down, brandishing her weapon within bare inches of the Scarlet Witch's face, only held back by the Scarlet Witch's powers Furiously, Vision pummels Corvus, then throws him across the roof, firing a beam from the Mind Stone. Corvus uses his glaive to deflect the beam, splitting it into several beams, cutting up Edinburgh's ancient stone like butter, until one branch finally reflects back at Vision, slamming him into the wall behind him. Down below, the Scarlet Witch has blocked Proxima's staff once again when she hears an agonized cry from Vision. Desperation strengthens her to throw Proxima through the burning lorry sliced in half by the split Stone beam, stunning the alien. The Scarlet Witch then flies up to the roof where Glaive has pinned Vision and is again attempting to remove the Mind Stone. Hands off. The Scarlet Witch casts a bolt of magic which throws Corvus back through the wall and down a shaft, then flies the two of them away again. Proxima, who has recovered, shoots a bolt from her weapon, causing them to fall from the air and down through the roof of Edinburgh Waverley Train Station. Wanda crawls over to Vision, who cannot muster the strength to stand. Come on. Come on. Come on, you gotta get up. You gotta get up. Come on. Hey. Hey. We have to go. Please. Please leave. You asked me to stay.... I'm staying. Please. Get up. Behind them, Proxima and Corvus crash through the roof and advance on them, brandishing their weapons. the Scarlet Witch moves protectively in front of Vision, building power in her hands. An express train passes behind Wanda, and Proxima cocks her head as if aware of another's presence. Confused, the Scarlet Witch also turns and looks over her left shoulder. As the last train car passes, we see a silhouette on the far side of the platform. Proxima throws her weapon at the shadowy figure, but it is deftly caught just before the figure steps from the shadows. As the Avengers theme kicks in, we now recognize a bearded and furious Steve Rogers (Captain America) as he steps into the light. Vision and the Scarlet Witch look hopeful and relieved. While all parties are distracted, Sam Wilson (Falcon) swoops in and kicks Proxima across the platform and through the closed cafe's security gate and furniture. Swooping around, he fires on Corvus. At the same time, Captain America throws Proxima's weapon to Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow) who engages Corvus, ducking under his swing, stabbing him in the gut and executing a flying kick to knock him backwards. Proxima, who has rushed back to the fight, summons her weapon back to her hand and attacks Black Widow. Captain America leaps forward, rolls, scoops up Corvus's dropped glaive and holds her off. Black Widow joins in with her own escrima sticks. While the three are fighting, Falcon returns and again kicks Proxima backwards; she scuttles over to the prone Corvus. Falcon draws both of his Steyr SPP submachine pistols on the couple. Get up. I can't. We don't wanna kill you. But we will. You'll never get the chance again. Proxima Midnight and Corvus Glaive depart as they are beamed up. The glaive is snatched from Captain America's hand as well. Can you stand? Thank you, Captain. Let's get you on the jet. I thought we had a deal. Stay close, check in. Don't take any chances. I'm sorry. We just wanted time. Where to, Cap? Home. Cut to the past, at Gamora's home planet Zen-Whoberi during Thanos' massacre. Gamora and her mother are hiding; the sounds of guns and screaming are outside.] Shh. We'll be safe. We'll be safe. An explosion goes off close by and Gamora screeches by reflex, revealing their hiding spot. The door is smashed open and both Zehobereians scream. Outside, it is utter chaos. Leviathans, Chitauri chariots and ring-ships fly overhead; explosions and energy bolts from numerous sources criss-cross the panicked population, felling them randomly; smoke arises from countless fires. Zehobereians… Mother! Where's my mother?! Zen-Whoberis... Choose a side, or die. Mother! One side is a revelation. The other, an honor known only to a few. Gamora turns and finds herself facing Thanos in his full Titan armor. What's wrong, little one? My mother. Where is my mother? What's your name? Gamora. You're quite the fighter, Gamora. Come. Let me help you. Thanos offers his hand; she wraps her little fingers around one massive finger, and he leads her to a pavilion, where he crouches to her eye level again and produces a small -- for him -- red-jeweled handle. Pressing the switch, razor-sharp blades pop out both ends. Look. Pretty, isn't it? Perfectly balanced. As all things should be. Too much to one side, or the other…  Here. You try. Thanos hands Gamora the dagger -- the handle is two child-palms' widths in length. She tries balancing it on her index finger. Now go in peace, and meet your Maker. One half of the crowd is shot down. The survivors scream in horror, and Gamora tries to turn but Thanos prevents her from seeing the massacre. Concentrate. There! You've got it. Cut to the present, aboard the GUARDIANS’ ship. Gamora is brooding, activates the spring-action blades on the same dagger. Gamora. Do you know if these grenades are the blow off your junk kind or the gas kind? 'Cause I was thinking I might hang a couple on my belt right here. But I don't want to-- I need to ask a favor. Yeah, sure. One way or another, the path that we're on leads to Thanos. Which is what the grenades are for.  I'm sorry. What's the favor? If things go wrong… If Thanos gets me… I want you to promise me… you'll kill me. What? I know something he doesn't. If he finds out… the entire Universe could be at risk. What do you know? If I tell you, you'd know, too. If it's so important, shouldn't I? Only if you wanna die. Why does somebody always have to die in this scenario? Just… trust me. And possibly, kill me. I mean, I'd like to. I really would… Swear to me. Swear to me on your mother. Okay. The two kiss, until an odd crunching sound startles them. Drax is standing in the corner. Dude. How long have you been standing there? An hour. An hour? Are you serious? I've mastered the ability of standing so incredibly still... that I become invisible to the eye... watch. Drax stands motionless, then very slowly raises his hand towards his mouth You're eating a zarg-nut. But my movement... was so slow... that it's imperceptible. Mmm, no. I'm sure I'm invisible. Hi, Drax. Damn it. The Benatar flies towards a massive skull and flies through one eye-hole into a vast interior cavern. Screen title: KNOWHERE. This place looks deserted. I'm reading movement from the third quadrant. Yep. I'm picking that up, too. Let's put it down right here. The four Guardians disembark and sneak into the Collector’s collection room, which is in ruins. Thanos is threatening the Collector while the Guardians hide behind rubble. I don't have it. Everyone in the Galaxy knows you'd sell your own brother if you thought it would add the slightest trinket to your pathetic collection. Quill stops, and holds up a fist meaning 'halt' in the silent language of soldiers. Everybody walks quietly past him. I know you have the Reality Stone, Tivan. Giving it to me will spare you a great deal of suffering. I told you. I sold it. Why would I lie? I imagine it's like breathing for you. Like suicide. So you do understand. Not even you would surrender something so precious. I didn't know what it was. Then you're more of a fool than I took you for. Last chance, charlatan. Where's the Stone? Today... Drax. Drax. ...He pays for the deaths of my wife and daughter. Drax, waaaaait!  Not yet, not yet, not yet.  Drax, Drax, Drax. He doesn't have the Stone yet. We get it, and then we can stop him. We have to get the Stone first. Yeah. No. No. For Ovette. For Camaria. Quill starts to struggle with Drax when Mantis puts her hand on the back of Drax's head. Sleeeep. Drax is knocked out, his falling body causing a loud crash. Everybody ducks. Thanos looks towards the sound, then picks up the Collector and throws him into a collecting case before walking towards the disturbance. Okay. Gamora, Mantis, you go right. I'm...  The other right! Gamora leaps on Thanos from a stack of boxes, swinging her sword at him. He snaps the sword-blade in half, and Gamora stabs him in the throat with the stub, his lower jaw sagging and himself letting out a hoarse groan, then he is stabbed in the chest with the red-jeweled dagger. Why?  Why you? Daughter… That was quick. The Collector starts clapping. Magnificent! Magnificent!!!! Magnificent!!!!!!! Suddenly, Thanos' disembodied voice fills the room. Is it sadness I sense in you, daughter? In my heart, I knew you still cared. But one ever knows for sure. The scene disappears -- everything in the room is destroyed and/or on fire, the Collector waving bye-bye as he and his case vanish. Reality is often disappointing...that is, it was. Now… reality can be whatever I want. Thanos is quite alive and undamaged. He has the red Reality Stone seated in the Infinity Gauntlet. You knew I'd come. I counted on it. There's something we need to discuss, little one. Gamora hesitates for a beat, then reaches for her broken sword. Thanos grabs her by the back of the neck and swings her around in front of him. NOOOOOO! THANOS!!! With a pulse of the Reality Stone, both Drax and Mantis are 'disassembled' -- Drax is turned into a stack of tumbling cubes, and Mantis becomes a ribbon version of herself. Let her go, Grimace! Peter… I told you to go right. Now? Really? You let her go! Ah, the boyfriend. I like to think of myself more as a Titan-killing long-term booty call. Let her go. Peter… Or I'm gonna blow that nut sack of a chin right off your face! Not him. Quill hesitates. He does not shoot anyone. You promised! You promised. Oh, daughter. You expect too much from him.  She's asked, hasn't she? Do it. [There is a very tense and unpleasant pause. Thanos rolls his head and shoves Gamora towards Quill’s gun, egging him on. DO IT!! I told you to go right. I love you, more than anything. I love you, too. Quill screws up his eyes and pulls the trigger -- but a stream of bubbles comes out. Thanos was playing him. I like you. Thanos teleports Gamora and himself away as a stunned Quill picks up Gamora's sword, and his friends painfully re-assemble themselves, the Reality Stone's effects now subsiding in its absence. Back on Earth, the Quinjet arrives at the upstate New York Avengers HQ while Col. James Rhodey Rhodes deals with the red tape in the holographic person of Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (Lt. Gen., USA Ret.). Still no word from Vision? Satellites lost him somewhere over Edinburgh. On a stolen Quinjet with four of the world's most wanted criminals. You know they're only criminals because you've chosen to call them that, right, sir? My God, Rhodes, your talent for horseshit rivals my own. If it weren't for those Accords, Vision would've been right here. I remember your signature on those papers, Colonel. That's right. And I'm pretty sure I've paid for that. You have second thoughts? Not anymore. The fugitive Avengers enter the room, Vision supported by Sam. Mr. Secretary. You got some nerve. I'll give you that. You could use some of that right now. The world's on fire. And you think, all is forgiven? I'm not looking for forgiveness. And I'm way past asking for permission. Earth just lost her best defender. So we're here to fight.  And if you wanna stand in our way... we'll fight you, too. Arrest them. All over it.  That's a court-martial. It's great to see you, Cap. You too, Rhodey. Well. You guys really look like crap. Must've been a rough couple of years. Yeah, well, the hotels weren't exactly five star. Uh, I think you look great.  Uh... heh... Yeah. I'm back. Hi, Bruce. Nat. This is awkward. Cut to a shot of Natasha, Bruce, Steve, Rhodey, Wanda, and Vision in another room. So we gotta assume they're coming back, right? And they can clearly find us. We need all hands on deck. Where's Clint? After the whole Accords situation, he and Scott took a deal. It was too tough on their families, they're on house arrest. Who's Scott? Ant-Man. There's an Ant-Man and a Spider-Man? Okay, look… Thanos has the biggest army in the universe. And he is not gonna stop until he... he gets... Vision's Stone. Well then, we have to protect it. No, we have to destroy it. I've been giving a good deal of thought to this entity in my head, about its nature. But also, its composition. I think if it were exposed to a sufficiently powerful energy source, something, very similar to its own signature, perhaps… its molecular integrity could fail. And you, with it. We're not having this conversation. Eliminating the stone is the only way to be certain that Thanos can't get it. That's too high a price. Only you have the power to pay it.  Thanos threatens half the Universe. One life cannot stand in the way of defeating him. But it should.  We don't trade lives, Vision. Captain, 70 years ago, you laid down your life to save how many millions of people. Tell me, why is this any different? Steve takes a breath, but before he has a chance to answer, Bruce speaks. Because you might have a choice. Your mind is made up of a complex construct of overlays. J.A.R.V.I.S., Ultron, Tony, me, the Stone. All of them mixed together. All of them learning from one another. You're saying Vision isn't just the stone? I'm saying that if we take out the stone, there's still a whole lot of Vision left. Perhaps the best parts. Can we do that? Not me. Not here. You better find someone, and somewhere fast. Ross isn't exactly just gonna let you guys have your old rooms back. I know somewhere. Cut to rural Wakanda, as King T'Challa and Okoye walk together, accompanied by two Kingsguard. Screen title: WAKANDA. You'll have the Kingsguard, and the Dora Milaje have been alerted. And the Border Tribe? Those that are left. Send word to the Jabari as well. M'Baku likes a good fight. And what of this one? This one may be tired of war.  But the White Wolf has rested long enough. The party reaches Bucky. A Kingsguards-man sets an elaborate and high-tech-looking equipment case down on the cart, opens the lid, and steps back. As the Winter Soldier approaches, he sees a new Vibranium arm in the case. Where's the fight? On its way. Cut to Ebony Maw interrogating Dr. Strange. Dr. Strange is floating horizontally, face down, and is surrounded by dozens of glassy needles, each about two feet long. In all the time I've served Thanos, I've never failed him. If I were to reach our rendezvous on Titan with the Time Stone still attached to your vaguely irritating person, there would be... judgement.  Give me... the stone. Cut to Tony who is watching, hidden, from above. The Cloak of Levitation taps Stark on the arm. He raises his hand to it, ready to shoot, but he sees what it is and stands down. Wow you're a seriously loyal piece of outerwear, aren't you? Yeah, uh, speaking of loyalty.... Tony and the Cloak turn to face Peter, dropping down from above What the-- I know what you're gonna say. You should not be here. The Cloak moves to stand at Tony's side I was gonna go home-- I don't wanna hear it. But it was such a long way down and I just thought about you on the way... And now I gotta hear it. The Cloak shakes its collar in sympathy and shrugs ...And I kinda stuck to the side of the ship. And this suit is ridiculously intuitive, by the way. So if anything, it's kinda your fault that I'm here. God damnit... The Cloak looks shocked. What did you just say? I take that back. And now I'm here in space. Yeah.  Right where I don't want you to be. This isn't Coney Island. This isn't a field trip. It's a one-way ticket. You hear me? Don't pretend like you thought this through. You could not have possibly thought this through. No. I did think this through. You could not have possibly thought this through. It's just...you can't be a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man if there's no neighborhood. He waits for Tony's reaction Okay. That didn't really make any sense, but you know what I'm trying to say. Come on. We got a situation.  See him down there? He's in trouble. What's your plan? Go. Um. Okay, okay... uh...  Okay. Did you ever see this really old movie, Aliens? The Cloak lifts its collar in surprise. Cut back to Ebony Maw interrogating Dr. Strange, who groans loudly. Painful aren't they? They were originally designed for microsurgery. And any one of them... At the thump behind him, Maw turns to see Iron Man standing there, hand repulsors ready to fire. ...Could end your friend's life in an instant. I gotta tell you, he's not really my friend. Saving his life is more a professional courtesy. You've saved nothing. Your powers are inconsequential compared to mine. Yeah, but the kid's seen more movies. Iron Man fires a rocket from his shoulder which pierces the side of the ship to Maw's right and begins to suck everything out with depressurization, especially Maw and his large objects. Dr. Strange is pulled loose of his pinnings, loses the needles, but also heads for the hole, helpless to resist. The Cape wraps around his arm and an anchor point, but Dr. Strange's arm slips loose and he keeps going. Spider-Man shoots a web strand at Dr. Strange with one hand and holds onto a piece of the ship with the other. It breaks, sending them both towards space when his Iron-Spider suit's metal arms brace him to keep him from being sucked out. Fortunately, Dr. Strange is still surrounded by the ship's atmosphere making haste to leave. Yes! Wait what are those?! Spider-Man crouches with his new spider-legs, and makes a mighty leap to pulls them both back inside. Iron Man quickly sprays nanites onto the hole to plug it up. Dr. Strange safely, if emphatically, hits the floor. Ebony Maw is seen floating in space, quite dead, ice from the escaped atmosphere frosting over his grimace. Spider-Man lands on his new legs, retracts them, and finds the Cape standing next to him. Hey, we haven't officially met.  Cool. Iron Man walks past Dr. Strange, shaking his head and with his armor retreating into its containment as Dr. Strange gets to his feet and becomes en-Cloaked. We've gotta turn this ship around. Yeah. Now he wants to run. Great plan. No, I want to protect the stone. Tony walks towards the expansive front view-port, showing a hyper speed/warp effect. And I want you to thank me now. Go ahead, I'm listening. For what? Nearly blasting me into space? Who just saved your magical ass? Me. I seriously don't know how you fit your head into that helmet. Admit it. You should have ducked out when I told you to. I tried to bench you. You refused. Unlike everyone else in your life, I don't work for you. And due to that fact, we're now in a flying doughnut billions of miles away from Earth with no backup. Seriously, these two's egos are a recipe for disaster. I'm backup. No. You're a stowaway.  The adults are talking. I'm sorry, I'm confused as to the relationship here. Wh-- what is he, your ward? No. I'm Peter, by the way. Dr. Strange. Oh, we're using our made-up names. Um... I'm Spider-Man, then. This ship is self-correcting its course. Thing's on autopilot. Can we control it? Fly us home?  Stark? Yeah? Can you get us home? Yeah I heard you. I'm thinking... I'm not so sure we should. Under no circumstance can we bring the Time Stone to Thanos. I don't think you quite understand what's at stake here. No. It's you who doesn't understand, that Thanos has been inside my head for six years since he sent an army to New York and now he's back! And I don't know what to do. So I'm not so sure if it's a better plan to fight him on our turf or his but you saw what they did, what they can do. At least on his turf, he's not expecting it. So I say we take the fight to him. Doctor. Do you concur? Alright, Stark. We go to him. But you have to understand... if it comes to saving you or the kid or the Time Stone... I will not hesitate to let either of you die. I can't, because the fate of the universe depends on it. Nice. Good. Moral compass. We're straight.  Alright, kid. You're an Avenger now. Peter looks at Tony in disbelief, and then cycles through delight, satisfaction, pride and determination, and braces himself for what's to come. Cut to Thanos' mother-ship, Sanctuary II, which dwarfs the massive ring-ships the Black Order have been using. Gamora sits near the throne deep inside the ship. Thanos walks up, bringing a cup of food and holds it out to her. I thought you might be hungry. Gamora takes it, then hurls it across the room where it bangs against Thanos' throne with a loud clack. I always hated that chair. So I've been told. Even so. I'd hoped you'd sit on it one day. I hated this room. This ship. I hated my life. You told me that too.  Every day. For almost twenty years. I was a child when you took me. I saved you. No. No. We were happy on my home planet. Going to bed hungry, scrounging for scraps. Your planet was on the brink of collapse. I'm the one who stopped that. Do you know what's happened since then? The children born have known nothing but full bellies and clear skies. It's a paradise. Because you murdered half the planet. A small price to pay for salvation. You're insane. Little one, it's a simple calculus. This universe is finite, its resources finite. If life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist. It needs correction- YOU DON'T KNOW THAT. I'm the only one who knows that. At least, I'm the only one with the will to act on it.  For a time... you had that same will... as you fought by my side. Daughter. I'm not your daughter. Everything I hate about myself you taught me. And in doing so, made you the fiercest woman in the galaxy. That's why I trusted you to find the Soul Stone. I'm sorry I disappointed you. I am disappointed. But not because you didn't find it.  But because you did.  And you lied. Thanos and Gamora stand outside a large solid door that slides open vertically as they approach, then pause as a set of inner doors made of interlacing metal slide away. Inside, we see Nebula face-on, suspended horizontally in the air in the middle of the room, her breath shuddering in pain. Nebula. Gamora hurries to to Nebula's left side, and we now see that she has been partially disassembled, her components stretched apart -- a cybernetic version of the medieval torture rack. Hannibal Lecter level of brutality. Don't do this. Some time ago, your sister snuck aboard this ship to kill me. Please don't do this. And very nearly succeeded. So I brought her here. To talk. Thanos curls his gauntleted fist, activating both the Power and Space Stones, scowling -- causing Nebula's already extended pieces to stretch further outward. She begins to scream. Stop. Stop it.  I swear to you on my life. I never found the Soul Stone. Thanos signals a nearby servant who taps on a control pad. We hear Nebula's voice say, Accessing memory files and a sort of hologram of Gamora's face shudders to life. You know what he's about to do. He's finally ready, and he's going for the stones. All of them. He can never get them all. He will! He can't, Nebula. Because I found the map to the Soul Stone and I burnt it to ash. I burnt it. The memory ends. You're strong. Me. You're generous. Me. But I never taught you to lie. That's why you're so bad at it.  Where is the Soul Stone? VORMIR!  The Stone is on Vormir. Show me. Cut to the pod taking Thor, Rocket and Groot to Nidavellir. I am Groot. Tinkle in the cup. We're not looking. What's there to see? What's a twig? Everybody's seen a twig. I am Groot. Tree, pour what's in the cup out in space, and go in the cup again. You speak Groot? Yes, they taught it on Asgard. It was an elective. I am Groot. You'll know when we're there. Nivadellir's forge harnesses the power of a blazing neutron star.  It's the birth place of my hammer. It's truly awesome. Rocket turns to see Thor sitting sadly beside the window, and sighs. Okay, time to be the captain.  So, dead brother, huh? Yeah, that can be annoying. Well, he's been dead before, but this time I think it really might be true. And you said your sister and your dad? Both dead. Still got a mom, though? Killed by a dark elf. A best friend? Stabbed through the heart. Are you sure you're up to this particular murder mission? Absolutely. Rage, vengeance, anger, loss, regret... they're all tremendous motivators. They really clear the mind. So I'm good to go. Yeah, but this Thanos we're talking about... he's the toughest there is. Well, he's never fought me. Yeah, he has! He's never fought me twice. And I'm getting a new hammer, don't forget. Better be some hammer. You know, I'm 1,500 years old. I've killed twice as many enemies as that, and every one would have rather killed me, but none succeeded. I'm only alive because fate wants me alive. Thanos is the latest in a long line of bastards and he will be the latest to feel my vengeance. Fate wills it so. And what if you're wrong? If I'm wrong then... what more could I lose? Thor sniffs and hastily wipes below his eye. He stands and seats himself at the front of the pod, beside Groot. I could lose a lot. Me personally. I could lose a lot.  Okay. If fate does want you to kill that crapsack... you're gonna need more than one stupid eyeball. What's this? What's it look like? Some jerk lost a bet with me on on Contraxia. He gave you his eye? He gave me 100 credits. I snuck in later that night and stole his eye. Thank you, sweet rabbit. Thor proceeds to put the eyeball in his socket. We are thankfully spared the explicit insertion. Hmm. Huh? Oh. I would've washed that. The only way I could sneak it off Contraxia was up my... Hey, we're here! I don't think this thing works. Everything seems dark. It ain't the eye. Nidavellir is dark and motionless as the three rings around it. Something's wrong. The star's gone out. And the rings are frozen. The pod flies through massive machinery, cold and inert. Screen title: NIDAVELLIR The pod sets down; Thor, Rocket and Groot disembark and start walking through a seemingly abandoned and cluttered space. Groot is still playing his game. I hope these dwarves are better at forging than they are cleaning. Maybe they realized they live in a junk pile in the middle of space. This forge hasn't gone dark in centuries.... You said Thanos had a gauntlet, right? Yes. Why? Look anything like that? I am Groot. Go back to the pod. Suddenly a massive figure storms towards them, flinging Thor away with one swing of his arm, and kicking Rocket and Groot against a wall of equipment. Eitri, wait! Stop! Thor? Eitri is played by the legendary Peter Dinklage -- his giant size literally juxtaposing his name of dwarf. What happened here? You were supposed to protect us. Asgard was supposed to protect us! Asgard is destroyed.  Eitri, the glove. What did you do? 300 dwarves lived on this ring. I thought if I did what he asked, they'd be safe. I made what he wanted. A device capable of harnessing the power of the stones. Then he killed everyone anyway. All except me. 'Your life is yours,' he said. 'But your hands are mine alone.' Eitri, this isn't about your hands. Every weapon you've ever designed: every ax, hammer, sword - it's all inside your head. Now I know it feels like all hope is lost. Trust me, I know. But together, you and I, we can kill Thanos. Cut to Nebula suspended in the interrogation room seen earlier, while a technician puts her back together. Nebula ejects her eyepiece and snaps the neck of the tech when he comes close enough to replace it. She walks to a console, straightening her left arm, dragging her still-dislocated right foot behind her, and inputs a code. Mantis, listen very carefully. I need you to meet me on Titan. Cut to Peter Parker, Tony Stark, and Dr. Strange aboard the ship approaching the surface of Titan. Hey, what's going on? I think we're here. I don't think this rig has a self-park function.  Get your hand into this steering gimbal. Close those around it. You understand? Yep, got it. This was meant for one big guy, so we gotta to move at the same time. Okay. Okay. Ready. The ringship is heading straight for the center of what looks like one of a colossal game of jacks. We might wanna turn. Turn! Turn! Turn!! Iron Man armors up as the ringship clips the jack obliquely, but still losing a good third of its hull in the collision. Spider-Man throws up his helmet at the same time. Doctor Strange steps between them and creates the Shield of the Seraphim around them all, anticipating a rough landing. The ship, now reduced to about 45%, plows through the dirt and stops, leaning slightly to one side. Screen title: TITAN. Doctor Strange helps Tony, now de-helmeted, to his feet; they're both panting a little from the exertion of arrival. You alright?  That was close. I owe you one. Spider-Man descends from above in classically spider-like fashion. Let me just say, if aliens wind up implanting eggs in my chest or something, and I eat one of you, I'm sorry. I don't wanna hear another single pop culture out of you for the rest of the trip. You understand? I'm trying to say that... something is coming. A grenade rolls into view, and Peter, Strange and Tony get thrown well back when it fires its energy pulse. Star-Lord, Drax, and Mantis appear in the doorway THANOS!!!! AH! Whoawhoawhoawhoa! PLEASE DON'T PUT YOUR EGGS IN ME! Spider-Man shoots web at Mantis in a panic, pinning arms to her body just before Star-Lord flies at him feet-first, kicking him away. Stay down, clown! Star-Lord can't quite counter spider reflexes at first; he fires at Spider-Man, who extends his spider legs and leaps away, but an electric-like cord wraps around Spider-Man and his six new legs when he tries to attack, sending him rolling across the deck. Die, blanket of death! Iron Man pulls free of the magnet; the Cloak pulls free of Drax as soon as Iron Man has a bead on his opponent and a foot on his torso. Star-Lord has Spider-Man in a head-lock, gun pointed at the smaller man's head. Doctor Strange has a mystical shield of golden energy up, and stands ready at the third point of the triangle. Mantis has struggled to her feet behind Star-Lord, still covered with webbing. Alright, everybody, stay where you are...chill the F out.  I'm gonna ask you this one time. Where's Gamora? Yeah, I'll do you one better. Who's Gamora? I'll do you one better. Why is Gamora? Tell me where the girl is, or I swear to you, I'm gonna French-fry this little freak. Let's do it! You shoot my guy, I blast him. Let's go! Do it, Quill! I can take it. No, he can't take it! She's right. You can't. Oh yeah? You don't wanna tell me where she is? That's fine. I'll kill all three of you and beat it out of Thanos myself.  Starting with you. Wait, what. Thanos?  Alright, let me ask you this one time: What master do you serve? What master do I serve? What am I supposed to say? Jesus? You're from Earth? I'm not from Earth. I'm from Missouri. Yeah, that's on Earth, dip-shit. What are you hassling us for? So, you're not with Thanos? With Thanos?! No, I'm here to kill Thanos! He took my girl- Wai- who are you? We're the Avengers, man. Oh. You're the ones Thor told us about! You know Thor!? Yeah. Tall guy, not that good-looking,  needed saving. Where is he now? Cut to Nivadellir where Eitri is showing Thor, Rocket, and Groot the mold for Stormbreaker. This is the plan? We're gonna hit him with a brick? It's a mold. A king's weapon. Meant to be the greatest in Asgard. In theory, it could even summon the Bifrost. Did it have a name? Stormbreaker. That's a bit much. So how do we make it? You'll have to restart the forge. Awaken the heart of a dying star. Rabbit, fire up the pod. Cut to Titan where the remaining Avengers and the Guardians are starting to work together. Quill is measuring the planet's tilt. The heck happened to this planet? It's eight degrees off its axis. Gravitational pull is all over the place. in the background, Mantis is jumping joyfully in a low gravity spot. Yeah, we got one advantage. He's coming to us. We'll use it. All right, I have a plan. Or at least the beginnings of one. It's pretty simple. We draw him in, pin him down, get what we need. Definitely don't wanna dance with this guy. We just want the gauntlet. Drax yawns. Are you yawning? In the middle of this, while I'm breaking it down? Huh? Did you hear what I said? I stopped listening after you said, We need a plan. Okay, Mr. Clean is on his own page. See, not winging it isn't really what they do. Uh, what exactly is it that they do? Kick names, take ass. Yeah, that's right. Alright, just get over here, please. Mr. Lord, can you get your folks to circle up? Mr. Lord. Star-Lord is fine. We gotta coalesce. 'Cause if all we come at him with is a plucky attitude.... Dude, don't call us plucky. We don't know what it means. Alright, we're optimistic, yes. I like your plan. Except it sucks, so let me do the plan, and that way it might be really good. Tell him about the dance-off to save the universe. What dance-off? It's not a... it's not... it's nothing. Like in Footloose, the movie? Exactly like Footloose. Is it still the greatest movie in history? It never was. Quill frowns sadly at him. Don't encourage this, alright? Okay. We're getting no help from Flash Gordon here. Flash Gordon? By the way, that's a compliment. Don't forget, I'm half human.  So that 50% of me that's stupid? That's 100% you. Your math is blowing my mind. Excuse me, but... does your friend often do that? Dr. Strange is sitting cross-legged, floating slightly above the ground, his hands poised in a mystic gesture with the Time Stone glowing brightly in the Eye of Agamotto setting. Green vapor-like energy flows from the stone, and more intricate magical energy patterns circle Dr. Strange's forearms. The Cloak of Levitation flows behind him as if the Stone is creating a strong breeze. His eyes are closed, and his head is jerking rapidly from side to side, the motion blurring, but resembling looking for something. Strange, we alright? Dr. Strange snaps out of his trance and falls forward, letting out a cry. You're back. You're alright. Hey, what was that? I went forward in time to view alternate futures. To see all the possible outcomes of the coming conflict. How many did you see? 14,000,605. How many did we win? Dr. Strange stares intently at Tony for a moment. One. Cut to Thanos and Gamora appearing on sand dunes alternating with shallow pools around the base of a mountain. The sun is in full eclipse, lending eerie lighting to the scene. Screen title: VORMIR The stone had better be up there... for your sister's sake. The walk up the mountain seems to be long, but not difficult. Paths worn by centuries or more of feet lead up to the summit, where Thanos and Gamora encounter a floating hooded figure] Welcome, Thanos, son of A'lars. Gamora, daughter of Thanos. You know us? It is my curse to know all who journey here. Where's the Soul Stone? You should know... it extracts a terrible price. I am prepared. We all think that at first.  We are all wrong. The Stonekeeper guides them to a temple-like structure at the summit. How is it you know this place so well? A lifetime ago, I, too, sought the stones. I even held one in my hand. But it cast me out, banished me here. Guiding others to a treasure I cannot possess. They stop on a semicircular engraving overlooking a sheer drop. It descends in three shallow steps to a final half-circle cutout, the whole bisected by a deep cut that runs between the two spires behind them. Far, far below is a full circle with similar engraved decoration. What you seek lies before you. As does what you fear. What's this? The price. Soul hold a special place among the Infinity Stones. You might say it has a certain wisdom. Tell me what it needs. To ensure that whoever possesses it... understands its power.... The stone demands a sacrifice. Of what? In order to take the stone, you must lose that which you love. A soul, for a soul. Gamora begins to laugh at the irony of the situation. All my life, I dreamed of a day... a moment when you would get what you deserved. And I was always so disappointed. But now... you kill and torture... and you call it mercy. The universe has judged you. You asked it for a prize, and it told you no. You failed. And do you wanna know why? Because you love nothing. No one. Really? Tears? They're not for him. Gamora looks at the Red Skull, and as her bitter smile fades, realizes what is about to happen, as do we.... No...This isn't love! I ignored my destiny once. I cannot do that again. Even for you.  I'm sorry, little one. NO! She tries in vain to break from his grasp, much like she tried to pull free from the Child of Thanos so many years ago, but, pain showing clearly on his face, he throws her over the edge, and watches sorrowfully as she falls to her death. Light pulses overhead as the sacrifice is correctly accomplished. Thanos finds himself lying in one of the shallow pools back at the base of the mountain. He opens his hand and sees that he now has the orange Soul Stone. Cut to the Quinjet where Sam is piloting Rhodey, Steve, Natasha, Wanda, and Vision. Drop to 2600, heading 0-3-0. I hope you're right about this, Cap. Or we're gonna land a lot faster than you want to. The Quinjet passes through a camouflage force field into Wakanda's Golden City's valley and lands at the airfield outside the palace. King T'Challa and the Dora Milaje approach to greet the arrivals When you said we were going to open Wakanda to the rest of the world... this is not what I imagined. And what did you imagine? The Olympics. Maybe even a Starbucks. The occupants of the Quinjet disembark, Steve and Natasha leading, followed by Bruce and Rhodey, with Vision and Wanda slowly taking up the rear. Should we bow? Yeah, he's a king. Seems like I'm always thanking you for something. Bruce bows awkwardly to King T'Challa. What are you doing? Uh, we don't do that here.  So how big of an assault can we expect? The group begins to walk back into the administrative building. Uh, sir, I think you can expect quite a big assault. How we looking? You will have my Kingsguard, the Border Tribe, the Dora Milaje, and... A semi-stable, 100-year-old man. The two friends share a hug. How you been, Buck? Uh, not bad, for the end of the world. In Shuri's lab, Shuri scans the Stone with her kimoyo beads while Vision lies on the examination table. She flips her hand over and studies the hologram projected over her palm. Whoa. The structure is polymorphic. Right, we had to attach each neuron non-sequentially. Why didn't you just reprogram the synapses to work collectively? Vision looks at Bruce as if to ask the same thing. Because, we didn't think of it. I'm sure you did your best. Can you do it? Yes, but there are more than two trillion neurons here. One misalignment could cause a cascade of circuit failures.  It will take time, brother. How long? As long as you can give me. Something's entered the atmosphere. Outside, Sam and Bucky look up at the sky Hey, Cap, we got a situation here. The defense shield over the Golden City destroys one of the alien vessels when it slams into the field at full attack acceleration. God, I love this place. Yeah, don't start celebrating yet, guys. We got more incoming outside the dome. The shock waves and debris from the ship landings destroy acres of forest and boil up against the dome. The lab has an excellent view of the landing sites. Captain America and Black Panther look at each other in concern over the scope of what they'll be facing. It's too late. We need to destroy the stone now. Vision, get your ass back on the table. We will hold them off. Wanda, as soon as the stone's out of his head... you blow it to hell. I will. Evacuate the city. Engage all defense procedures.  And get this man a shield. Cut to Nivadellir where Rocket is in the pod, and Thor, without any environmental suit, jumps from the hull onto the ring surface with a cable in his hand attached to the pod. I don't think you get the scientifics here. These rings are gigantic. You wanna get them moving, you're gonna need something a lot bigger to yank 'em loose. Leave that to me. Leave that to you? Buddy, you're in space. All you got is a rope and a-- Fire the engines! Nnnyah! MORE... POWER... RABBIT! Thor commits bicep porn while Rocket accelerates for all he's worth. Finally the rings spin free, realigning into effective configuration as the star bursts back into life. Well done, boy. Thor, clutching the pod's forward windows, points to the star. That's Nivadellir! Rocket gazes amazed at the blazing core. An iris on the cladding around the star opens, firing pure stellar heat through the ring portals and into the forge... until the damaged mechanism fails, crumbles loose and slams shut. The iris closes and the beam of light trails off. Damn it. Damn it? What's damn it? The mechanism is crippled. What? With the iris closed I can't heat the metal. How long will it take to heat? A few minutes, maybe more. Why? I'm gonna hold it open. That's suicide. So is facing Thanos without that ax. Cut to the Wakandan battlefield. Carriers hover over the ground with Wakandan soldiers and Natasha, Steve and Bucky on board; Rhodey and Sam keep pace overhead, and Bruce is in the Hulkbuster armor. How we looking, Bruce? Yeah, I think I'm getting the hang of it. Wow! It's like being the Hulk without actually--  I'm okay. I'm okay. I got two heat signatures breaking through the tree line. The heat signatures are Proxima Midnight and Cull Obsidian. The carrier pilots swerve into U-turns, causing their craft to tilt and allowing the practiced soldiers to slide over one side into a run, never coming to a complete halt. A Dora Milaje shouts a command nearby as the last Wakandans join ranks. MIE EFFA!  YA HU! MIE EFFA! YA HU! MIE EFFA! YA HU! MIE EFFA! YA HU! MIE EFFA! YA HU! Thank you for standing with us. Of course, brother. The Black Panther, Captain America, and Black Widow walk to the edge of the barrier, where Proxima Midnight and Cull Obsidian stand. Proxima tests the strength of the barrier by drawing her sword across it consideringly. Where's your other friend? You will pay for his life with yours. Thanos will have that stone. That's not gonna happen. You are in Wakanda now. Thanos will have nothing but dust and blood. We... have blood to spare. The three heroes return to the massed forces. Did they surrender? Not exactly. The Black Panther leads the Wakandans in the war cry Yibambe! telling them to hold fast as the Outriders bound toward the barrier; Proxima drops her sword arm down in the signal to attack. What the hell. Looks like we pissed her off. They're killing themselves. As a few Outriders managed to squeeze through intact, the Border Tribe take a knee and raise their shields. The Kingsguard behind them level their sonic spears over their comrades' shoulders, and on Black Panther's command, fire at the approaching monsters. The Winter Soldier uses his M-249 machine gun, and Bruce fires the Hulkbuster's hand repulsors. You seen the teeth on those things? Alright, back up, Sam. You're gonna get your wings singed. Everyone notices a pack of Outriders starting to run around the force-field to the right of the defenders' position. Cap, if these things circle the perimeter and get in behind us... there's nothing between them and Vision. Them we better keep 'em in front of us. How do we do that? We open the barrier.  On my signal, open North-West Section Seventeen. Requesting confirmation, my King. You said open the barrier? On my signal. This will be the end of Wakanda. Then it will be the noblest ending in history. Captain America readies one of his Vibranium hand guards. The Black Panther shouts a command in Xhosa; the Border Tribesmen disengage their shields and stand, as the Black Panther walks out in front of them, never taking his eyes off the enemy. WAKANDA FOREVER!!!!  Now! The Outriders pour through, distracted from trying to find any other access. The Black Panther and Captain America pull ahead rapidly due to their enhancements, and literally leap into battle. How much longer, Shuri? We've barely begun, brother. You might want to pick up the pace. Simultaneously, Thor prepares to open the iris of Nidavellir. Allfathers, give me strength. You understand, boy? You're about to take the full force of a star. It'll kill you. Only if I die. Yes. That's what... killing you means. Thor grasps the two levers and pulls them down and towards himself, slowly opening the iris. The stream of stellar energy blasts past him and into the forge once again. Hold it! Hold it, Thor! Eitri watches the metal ingots melt while Thor is looking increasingly charred. Finally, Eitri is able to tip the cauldron, pouring the metal into the mold just as Thor passes out. The jet carries him into the forge, Rocket follows hastily and landing after Thor bounces limply off a structure to land on the floor. Groot finally looks up from his game at the thump Thor's body makes. Thor! Say something. Come on. Thor, you okay? Eitri clumsily and urgently pulls the mold, still glowing red-hot, onto the floor, breaking it loose from its frame, then starts punching the mold itself with his metal fists to free the ax. I think he's dying! He needs the ax! Stormbreaker's two sections -- the hammer and the ax-blade -- lay glowing on the floor. Groot looks sadly at Thor for a moment. Where's the handle? Tree, help me find the handle! And with a boost of determination, he stands up and and extends his fingers towards the Stormbreaker, growing them at extraordinary speed. As he twines them around the two parts, he cries out at the burning pain but does not hesitate, slamming them together and locking them permanently into one structure. He raises it above his head, and with a mighty cry, chops his extended arm with his other hand to sever it at the right length. Thor's fingers twitch, and the new weapon levitates in a crackle of lightning echoed by the sparks between Thor's fingers. The remaining Avengers and Wakandans are struggling against the Outriders. The Winter Soldier goes down, and fights off Outrider fangs snapping at his head. Captain America and the Black Panther still fight side-by-side. War Machine hovers over the breach, pouring ammunition into the flood of bodies until a huge hammer -- Cull Obsidian's -- knocks him out of the sky and to the ground. The Hulkbuster is dogpiled and pinned. There’s too many of them! GYAH! AAAAHHHHH! Suddenly, a large beam of rainbow-hued light lands in the middle of the action, and an ax flies out of it, wreathed with lightning and tearing through the Outriders, freeing the heroes. It flies back to the light and into its master's hand just as the beam cuts out, revealing Thor, Groot and Rocket [The Avengers theme swelling triumphantly at their arrival] who chambers a round in his large gun. Black Widow, Captain America and the Black Panther pause in astonishment. Proxima Midnight and Cull Obsidian pause in apprehension. AH-hahaha! You guys are so screwed now! BRING ME THANOS! Cut to Titan, where Thanos arrives, finding only fresh debris from Ebony Maw's ship. Oh, yeah...you're much more of a Thanos. I take it, the Maw is dead. This day extracts a heavy toll. Still, he accomplished his mission. You may regret that. He brought you face-to-face with the Master of the Mystic Arts. And where do you think he brought you? Let me guess. Your home? It was. And it was beautiful.  Titan was like most planets. Too many mouths, and not enough to go around. And when we faced extinction, I offered a solution. Genocide. But at random, dispassionate, fair to rich and poor alike. They called me a madman. And what I predicted came to pass. Congratulations. You're a prophet. I'm a survivor. Who wants to murder trillions. With all six stones, I could simply snap my fingers, and they would all cease to exist; I call that... mercy. And then what? I finally rest...and watch the sun rise on a grateful universe. The hardest choices require the strongest wills. I think you'll find our will...equal...to yours. Ours? Piece of cake, Quill. Yeah, if your goal was to piss him off! The wreckage on top of Thanos erupts in purple, as he bellows in rage. He turns the hovering fragments into a flock of bats with the Reality Stone and swarms Iron Man with them, driving him back through the ruins. Spider-Man webs his eyes, and swings in to kick him in the face at the same time that Drax leaps from cover, blades in both hands, to knee-slide behind Thanos and try for a tendon slide across the back of the Titan's knee. Doctor Strange jumps through a portal and summons a sword of golden energy, dueling with Thanos while Drax attacks similarly on his other side. Thanos punches Drax through a ruined wall, then shatters the blade with one hand and tears the web from his eyes. He advances on Doctor Strange and kicks at him, but Strange's shield absorbs the damage -- the Cloak lifts him free of the ground. Star-Lord has been making his way back on the ground, and shoots Thanos from behind. Thanos uses the Power Stone to shoot balls of energy at Star-Lord while Star-Lord leaps towards Thanos using magical platforms thrown in his path by Doctor Strange, the last one placed above Thanos' head so Star-Lord can flip over him and slap a mine on Thanos' back. Star-Lord sticks his landing, he disengages his helmet, flips Thanos a bird and falls backward into a portal. Boom! The explosion knocks Thanos to his knees and dazes him briefly. Do not let him close his fist. Doctor Strange starts throwing portals everywhere. Spider-Man leaps through one on Thanos' left Magic!  More magic!  Magic with a kick!  Magic with a-- Before he can finish Thanos turns, grabbing him from the air, and throwing him to the ground, with his hand around his neck. Insect! He then throws him at Doctor Strange, knocking them both down. Thanos finally tears the Cloak away and is then promptly surrounded by fiery explosions as Iron Man bombards him. He sucks all the flame into the gauntlet with the Power Stone and fires it in a stream at Iron Man, hitting him dead on and sending him far away, plowing through a massive fallen machine. Spider-Man leaps from behind, more conventionally this time, while Thanos concentrates his fire on Iron Man, webs the gauntlet and drops down in front of him, pulling hard -- but Thanos yanks on the web-line, pulling the much lighter teenager towards him, and punching him on his way past. He tears the webbing free of the gauntlet just in time for a small spaceship to attempt to crash-land on him. The ship drags Thanos along for a distance, burying him under debris. He stands just as the pilot leaps in a great arc to punch him, landing in front of him with an energy-blade at the ready. Well, well. You should have killed me. It would've been a waste of parts! Where's Gamora?! Thanos punches her away. Doctor Strange uses the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak to pinion the gauntlet, pulling Thanos' fingers open and trying to pry the gauntlet off his hand. Thanos tries to pull free, as Drax slides in from his right, kicking his knee and knocking him off-balance, then wrapping himself around Thanos' kneeling leg. Star-Lord shoots a electric trap onto the ground to Thanos' right, the tangle-field holding down his unarmored hand. Spider-Man swings in, webs Thanos' chest then wraps it around behind him, digging his Iron Spider legs into the ground to anchor himself. Doctor Strange opens a portal straight above Thanos' out of which drops Mantis, landing on the Titan's shoulders, her hands on his temples. He bellows as she tries to put him under. Iron Man, having returned, is pulling on the gauntlet. Doctor Strange reapplies the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak to reinforce the trap's hold on Thanos' right hand, and the Cloak helps him pull. Thanos is finally subdued enough to incapacitate, not fully asleep. Is he under? Don't let up. Be quick. He is very strong. Parker, help! Get over here.  She can't hold him much longer. Let's go. I thought you'd be harder to catch. For the record, this was my plan. Not so strong now, huh? Where is Gamora? My Gamora...? No, bull-shit. Where is she? He is in anguish. Good. He… he mourns. What does this monster have to mourn? Gamora. What? He took her to Vormir. He came back with the Soul Stone... but she didn't. Okay, Quill, you gotta cool it right now, you understand? Quill slowly turns to Thanos, Don't, don't, don't engage, we've almost got this off! Tell me she's lying.  Asshole! Tell me you didn't do it! I... had... to. No, you didn't…! No, you didn't…!  NO, YOU DIDN'T! QUILL! Iron Man leaps for Star-Lord's arm, re-helmeting and leaving Spider-Man to pull off the gauntlet. Hey, stop! Hey, stop! Stop! Hey, stop! Stop! It's coming! It's coming! It's coming!  I got it! I got it.... ! Thanos wakes completely, now well and truly furious. He head-butts Mantis, grabbing the cuff of the gauntlet just as it is sliding off his hand, causing Spider-Man to stumble back, and then throwing Mantis away off his shoulders. Oh, God! Thanos kicks Drax off his right leg and into Nebula and Star-Lord, knocking them down. He yanks on the Crimson Bands holding his right hand to throw Doctor Strange far away, and swats away Iron Man and his repulsor shots. The remaining Guardians jump up and charge him again, but he fires a pulse of indigo energy at them that knocks the three of them completely unconscious. Iron Man zooms back in, his nanite arm cannon manifested, and is head-butted to the ground. Thanos looks at him for a beat, then raises the gauntlet towards Titan's moon. Iron Man stares, aghast. Thanos uses a combination of the Power and Space Stones to shatter the moon's surface, then bring the debris down on the field of battle at speed. Iron Man powers out of the way but is caught by a chunk of moon about the size of a baseball field, slamming him into the ground. The Guardians go sailing into the air from the rebound. Back in Wakanda, Shuri is working steadily to complete the Mind Stone's removal; Wanda stands by tensely The Kingsguard, Borderers and Jabari have little success going against Cull Obsidian's chained hammer -- he either sends them flying or punches them into the ground. The Black Panther gets free of his other sorties, leaps and uses all his collected kinetic energy behind a punch that lays Obsidian flat. Come and get some, space dogs!  Come on, get some, get some! Come on, get some!  How much for the gun? Not for sale. Okay, how much for the arm?  Oh, I'll get that arm. The tides of battle cause Thor, using Stormbreaker to great effect, and Captain America together. They take a breather. New haircut? Notice you've copied my beard. Captain America nods, wearily gesturing at his own face with a shield-covered hand. Groot skewers three Outriders with his right arm. By the way, this is a friend of mine. Tree. I AM GROOT! I am Steve Rogers. In Shuri's lab, a deep rumbling can be heard even at their height. Wanda looks down on the battlefield, and sees movement through the blazing forest between the troopships and the dome. When the disturbance reaches the edge of the trees, it turns into vast moving mounds of earth that easily bypass the force field and emerge -- Threshers, sets of massive, motorized spiked wheels, intended for nothing more than shredding everything in their paths. Fall back! Fall back now! Wanda watches as at least one set of Threshers separates into individual wheels and starts veering all over the battlefield, and then looks anxiously back at Vision Focus that fire on the left flank, Sam. I'm doing it. Black Widow with her escrima sticks and Okoye with her augmented spear have drifted together when they're suddenly in the path of a Thresher. Both women cringe at their seemingly inevitable shredding when the Scarlet Witch lands in front of both of them, eyes glowing red, lifting the whole Thresher well clear of the ground. Looking behind her, the friendly forces have scattered and replaced by a charging mob of Outriders -- the perfect place to throw a Thresher. Black Widow straightens with a pleased smile, Okoye with an amazed look. Why was she up there all this time? The Children of Thanos help answer that question. She's on the field. Take it. Corvus Glaive kills one of the guards just outside the lab, alerting Shuri to the problem. She starts hastily disconnecting her equipment from Vision's systems; he gasps at the sensations. The Dora Milaje engages Glaive but is sent skidding across the floor. Shuri finishes her shutdown, grabs one of her sonic panther-paws and fires at Glaive. The Dora attacks again, and Glaive sends both her and Shuri through the balcony railing and onto the main lab floor. Vision is not where Corvus Glaive expects to find him. Vision is, in fact, charging at him and knocking him out the window to fall many meters down the face of Mount Bashenga. Guys, we got a Vision situation here. Somebody get to Vision! I got him! On my way. He'll die alone. As will you. She's not alone. Okoye silently brandishes her spear on the other side of Proxima and nods at Black Widow. Euuyaaah! Corvus Glaive kicks Vision, knocking him down; as he attempts to rise again, Cull Obsidian shows up and swings his hammer in a full arc, throwing Vision even further. He painfully starts to climb to his feet again when a whooshing overhead interrupts the fight as Bruce Banner lands the Hulkbuster between the aliens and the android. He takes a defensive stance, pointing one hand's repulsor at each. Oh no, oh no you don't. This isn't going to be like New York, pal. This suit's already kicked the crap out of the Hulk-- Guys! Vision needs backup now!   Hulk. Hulk, I know you like making your entrance at the last second, well, this is it, man. This is the last, last second.  Ahhhhh! Hulk! Hulk! HULK! NOOOO!!! Oh, screw you, ya big green asshole! I'll do it myself!  Come on! He charges the alien, jumps into the air and delivers an effective punch with his remaining hand -- swat, punch, hammer -- except that blow is caught by Obsidian, who punches back, knocking Bruce flat. Obsidian changes his left hand armor into a pointed weapon, and lunges forward to deliver a likely fatal blow, when Bruce grabs the detached Hulkbuster arm out of the water, holding it so Obsidian impales that instead, and slaps the controls. See you later, Alligator!  Hulk, we got a lot to figure out, pal. Proxima Midnight alternates heavy blows between her two opponents, but all three of them duck as a single-wheel Thresher tears overhead, the ditch sparing them most of the danger from the wheel-blades. Proxima uses the distraction to kick Black Widow in the face, sending her to the ground. She then grabs Okoye by the shoulder and weapon and throws her meters away. Simultaneously, Corvus Glaive and Vision struggle in the forest at the foot of Mount Bashenga. Glaive grasps Vision's shoulder and uses the leverage to plunge his blade once more into the android's chest. I thought you were formidable, machine. But you're dying, like any man. Get outta here!  GO! Black Widow splits her staff back into a pair of sticks to block Proxima Midnight's sword blows, and finally knocks it from her hand. The alien takes to her bare fists instead, knocks down and pins the Black Widow. Proxima triggers an arm-blade from her left-arm armor, and stabs at Black Widow, who barely manages to block the blade with her crossed sticks. As the edge starts to dig into Black Widow's neck anyway, scarlet energy grabs the alien and tosses her into the air right into the path of another passing Thresher. Dark blue blood spatters the women below. The Scarlet Witch sits up, sighing with relief, her hands still shimmering. That was really gross. Captain America keeps blocking Corvus Glaive's staff weapon using his shields, finally knocking it from the alien's hands just before he's thrown over a fallen tree and pinned, Glaive's hand at his throat. Even with his physical abilities, Captain America's struggling -- until a glaive-blade pierces Glaive's chest, and is pushed all the way through. Vision raises his enemy in a perfect mirror of the first attack on him, and holds him for a moment, before dropping Glaive's corpse to one side and collapsing exhaustively. I thought I told you to go. We don't trade lives, Captain. The remaining Guardians and Avengers are dealing with the gravitic aftermath of dumping a large chunk of moon onto an unstable planet's surface. The unconscious Guardians are flying upwards uncontrollably, moon-chunks are still making fiery ballistic in-bounds, and random debris and massive rocks are floating in any possible direction. Spider-Man is well-equipped to handle this physically, even if he's freaking out emotionally. I got you! I got you!  I'm sorry I can't remember anybody's names! The Cloak of Levitation sets Doctor Strange down on a relatively stable outcrop as Thanos extricates himself from rubble. The Sorcerer Supreme makes a few passes with his hands, producing the familiar golden magic filigree circles, and slams his hands down on the rock before him, invoking the Seven Suns of Cinnibus as a lightning-like effect of immense heat jumping from rock to rock until it reaches Thanos, sending him flying -- but he makes use of the erratic gravity to keep control and fire back a blast from the Power Stone. Doctor Strange blocks the purple plume with a wall of Mirror Dimension, which he then pushes back at Thanos. It shatters around the Titan, who suctions the magic into a miniature black hole with the Space Stone, volleying it back at Doctor Strange. Just in time, Doctor Strange raises a shield and changes the dark energy into a swarm of aqua butterflies which return to their master. Before Thanos can counterattack again, Doctor Strange levitates and invokes the Images of Ikonn, giving him arms like a Hindu deity before dozens of Strange replications rush away, forming a circular wall around a snarling Thanos. They call cast magical cords, wrapping around Thanos' torso, arms and hands; he struggles to close his gauntleted fist, and uses the Soul and Power Stones to discover the real Doctor Strange among the many copies, blowing the duplicates away and sending the singular Doctor Strange reeling. Reality and Space pull Doctor Strange forward, Thanos grasping him by the throat once in range. Doctor Strange grabs futilely at Thanos' hand. You're full of tricks, wizard. No! Yet you never once used your greatest weapon.  A fake. Almost simultaneously, a red and gold device slaps into the palm of the Infinity Gauntlet, bracing the fingers open; and a red and gold Avenger makes a fast and hard entrance. You throw another moon at me, and I'm gonna lose it. Stark. You know me? I do. You're not the only one cursed with knowledge. My only curse is you. Come on! The rockets all explode on target, momentarily shrouding Thanos in smoke. Before it clears, Iron Man pile drives into Thanos horizontally, using his single super-jet boot configuration. As he bounces off, he flips and sticks his landing, immediately re-configuring his boots into ground clamps for stability and his gloves into rocket-driven battering rams, punching Thanos into a ruined wall behind him. Thanos shakes it off quickly, reaches forward and tears Iron Man's helmet off, revealing Tony's surprised expression before the suit recovers automatically and re-forms his head protection. The Titan makes use of the fractional delay and punches back hard, sending Iron Man sliding meters away, giving Thanos time to rip the brace device off the gauntlet. He immediately uses the Power Stone to stream furiously lambent energy at his opponent, who forms a shield to kneel behind just as instantly, getting pushed back even further by the incredible force. Iron Man slides out from behind the shield, letting the angled energy push him away for a faster start, and whips back to Thanos full thrusters; he kicks at the Titan with his left foot, turning the boot into a ground clamp at the same time to pin the gauntlet, and keeps twisting while his left glove becomes a ram again, slamming into Thanos' face, cutting his cheek. All that for a drop of blood. He smiles briefly before punching Iron Man, sending him pinwheeling, then starts beating him with his fists. Iron Man attempts to block the blows with his forearms, but Thanos is relentless, picking him up by the helmet and blasting his midsection with the Power Stone. The gaps in nanite coverage are now gaping, as the armor loses the ability to recover from the intensity and extent of the damage. Iron Man lands hard from the Power blast, struggles to one knee and fires his right hand repulsor at the inexorable Thanos; the beam is easily deflected by the gauntlet. He gets to both feet as the suit tries to complete repairs, adding the beam from his left hand as well. Thanos walks right up to him, and backhands the incomplete helmet completely off Tony's head. He crosses his arms to block a blow from Thanos' gauntlet, and has his left hand caught over his head. In desperation, he forms what's left of his right glove into a short-sword, which is also easily caught by Thanos, snapping it off clean and driving it through Tony's left side. The fight is over. Thanos walks Tony back until he sits, and places the gauntlet almost comfortingly on Tony's head. You have my respect, Stark. When I'm done, half of humanity will still be alive.  I hope they remember you. Tony's just a little distracted with the pain, and blood drooling out of his mouth, and compromised breathing. Thanos raises the gauntlet, closing his fist, all four Stones glowing Stop!  Spare his life... and I will give you the stone. No tricks. Don't...! Doctor Strange reaches up and plucks the Time Stone out of its hiding place in the stars. He opens his hand, the scars on his fingers and their inherent trembling particularly obvious now, and the Stone floats to Thanos' bare hand. Doctor Strange watches him intently, as he takes the Stone and drops it into the thumb setting, the energy pulse making the Titan wince. One to go. Thanos doesn't even bother responding to the assault -- he just leaves. Star-Lord flies through where Thanos had been and crashes, rolling several times Where is he?! Tony stitches up his stab wound as well as he can with his suit functions; he has no breath for answers. Did we just lose? Why would you do that? We're in the Endgame now. M'Baka bashes another Outrider -- the ground game has improved considerably with the addition of the God of Thunder. His tribesmen are equally successful around him. MAYEFA! YA HU HU! Thor is in the air, using Stormbringer on the Outrider drop ships which are now retreating. He is having considerably more success than the Wakandan Dragon fliers firing on the fleeing ships. Are you okay?  What? What is it? He's here. The wind picks up. It feels... strange. Eerie. Everyone, on my position. We have incoming. What the hell? Cap. That's him. Eyes up. Stay sharp. Bruce reaches Thanos first, lunging forward fist-first -- but Thanos uses the Space Stone on him, renders him immaterial until the Hulkbuster is half-buried in the stone of the cliff behind him, and freezes Bruce in place. Captain America is sent flying by purple energy before he even gets to strike a single blow. The Black Panther, armor fully charged kinetically, leaps high and with claws extended, but is easily grabbed by the throat and punched to the ground, his armor discharging violently. Falcon stoops, strafing with both Steyr pistols, but is felled when his wings become rubbery and unable to sustain flight. Wanda. It's time. No. They can't stop him, Wanda, but we can. Look at me. You have the power to destroy the stone. Don't. You must do it. Wanda, please. We. Are. Out of time. I can't. Yes, you can. You can. If he gets the stone, half the universe dies. I- It's not fair. It shouldn't be you, but it is. It's all right. You could never hurt me.... I just...feel you. The following action is mostly muted. War Machine joins the fight, firing his guns at Thanos until he uses the gauntlet to crush his armor around him and toss him aside. The Winter Soldier runs in firing, and is punched away by the Power Stone. Okoye activates the Vibranium-powered elements on her spear and flings it; Power stops it inches from Thanos, and throws her and it aside while wrapping the Black Widow in inescapable bands of earth. Groot stabs his hands into the ground to wrap Thanos in cables of roots, which he breaks easily. The Scarlet Witch watches all this over one shoulder, and turns back to Vision to add her left hand to her tearful effort. Captain America slides under one blow and comes up swinging his deployed arm-shields, punching Thanos in the gut and chin. He grabs the gauntlet, keeping Thanos' fingers un-clenched. Thanos looks very briefly impressed at Captain America's efforts as he screams before slamming a fist into his head and rendering him insensible. The Scarlet Witch looks over her shoulder again and sees Thanos approaching unopposed. She swings her left hand around to fend him off with a stream of scarlet energy, and pushes him back despite his blue-purple energy shield, but then he starts to make slow headway. It's all right. It's all right. I love you. At those words, the yellow Mind Stone finally starts to crack. Vision's face is overcome by an expression of joyful peace, and as the crystal fragments completely, a pulse of pure yellow energy explodes from him, shuddering the trees for many meters around his epicenter. Wanda's and Thanos' energy subsides. I understand, my child. Better than anyone. You could never... Today, I lost more than you can know. But now is no time to mourn. Now... is no time at all. NO! Thanos picks up Vision by the throat, lifting him to eye-level, and digs the fingers of his right hand into Vision's forehead, digging out the Mind Stone. He pulls it loose, and Vision goes limp and colorless; he tosses the lifeless android aside like trash. Bringing his gauntleted hand up, he slowly moves the Mind Stone over the last empty setting, and drops it in. The energy surge is much more than any previous -- his torso is wreathed with iridescent static and he bellows from the sensations. As Thanos studies the completed gauntlet, a massive bolt of lighting strikes him, digging him into the ground and grinding him back for meters. Thor has arrived, eyes glowing with power, stooping down from the sky like a bird of prey. The God of Thunder pauses his attack, reverses his position, raises Stormbreaker above his head and hurls it -- Thanos fires the whole might of the gauntlet against it, but it only creates a rainbow-like bow-shock, not slowing the ax as it slams right into Thanos' chest. I told you. You'd die for that! He takes hold of the back of Thanos' head and forces Stormbreaker deeper into his chest, staring angrily into his eyes while Thanos cries out in pain You should have... you...  You should have gone for the head! He raises his gauntlet and snaps his fingers. NO! The scene whites out. It cuts sharply to a view of Thanos his hand on his chest, no wounds visible. Thanos now seems to be inside the Soul Stone, where he sees a child and the pavilion from the home world of the Zen-Whoberi. Daughter? The child turns around, revealing herself to be Young Gamora. Did you do it? Yes. He looks down. What did it cost? Everything. Now out of the Soul World, Thanos is snapped back to reality, and notices the damage inflicted on the gauntlet -- the metal scorched and distorted from heat, the stones no longer glowing. What'd you do? WHAT DID YOU DO?! Thanos nearly seems to not notice Thor before he uses the Space Stone and teleports away, leaving Stormbreaker behind on Wakandan ground. Where'd he go? Thor... where'd he go? Steve? Bucky suddenly stumbles over, drops his gun and collapses into ashes, much to Steve's shock; he walks over and touches the ground where Bucky's ashes evaporated disbelievingly. On the battlefield, Wakandan soldiers disintegrate to ashes, much to M'Baku's horror. Up, General. Up! This is no place to die. Kumkani?! I am Groot... off-screen Okoye repeats herself No... no. No. No. No! Groot, no... Wanda is mourning over Vision. She then turns into ashes. An injured Sam turns to ashes, hidden in the undergrowth. Sam?  Sam, where you at?! On Titan, the remaining members of the Guardians and Avengers collect themselves -- Mantis props up Star-Lord, Spider-Man helps Tony to his feet, Drax and Nebula manage to limp over on their own. Something's happening. Quill looks behind him as he sees Drax disintegrate Quill? Quill stares in horror as he turns back to Stark. Steady, Quill. Aw, man. Tony, there was no other way. Mr. Stark?  I don't feel so good... You're all right? I don't know what's -- I don't know what's happening. I don't--  I don't wanna go, I don't wanna go, Mr. Stark, please. Please, I don't wanna go. I don't wanna go...  I'm sorry. Tony falls forward from the lack of weight in his arms, before staring at his hands in disbelief. He did it. Stark mourns silently at their failure. Back on Wakanda, the remaining team members, Captain America, Thor, War Machine, Black Widow, Bruce Banner, and Rocket are left mourning near Vision's dead body. Captain America turns over Vision's bleached corpse as Black Widow runs up to the other survivors. What is this? What the hell is happening? Oh, God. Meanwhile, in a different place, in a rustic house on a terraced slope with a scarecrow made of discarded armor, Thanos sits down and watches the sun rise. In the mid-credits scene, nothing is shown. But 2 voices are heard. Still no word from Stark? No, not yet. We're watching every satellite in both hemispheres, there's still nothing. The screen now shows Nick Fury and Maria Hill on Earth, driving in a car. What is it? Multiple bogeys over Wakanda. Same energy signatures as New York? Ten times bigger. Tell Klein. We'll meet him at- - Nick, Nick! They okay? Behind their vehicle, a motorcycle lies in the middle of the street with a concerned citizen approaching it. There's no one here. They hear helicopter rotor sounds from the direction they'd come, but it sounds wrong -- a Leonardo executive helicopter, tail rotor smoking from damage already, appears and crashes nose-first into a building. Screaming intensifies. The two are now witnessing civilians around them suddenly disintegrating. Call Control. Code Red. Nick? Fury turns around to see Hill disintegrating. Hill? Fury then races back to their car and gets a what appears to be an old pager with extra gear attached out of his bag on the back seat. He sends out an emergency alert, mere seconds before his hand turns into ashes. Oh, no... Motherf... Before he could finish the line, Fury corrodes to dust. The pager falls to the ground, red lights blinking on the additions; the camera zooms in and we see the device display SENDING... then display a red-blue-and-gold star insignia -- the symbol of Captain Marvel.] [Cut to black.\n"

By standardizing all the text to be in one format (lowercase), we can prevent mixed-case occurences of a word. Different variations in capitalization could result in different outputs, thus lowercasing the entire text prevents from counting the same word as a different one. For example, if we compared \"Stones\" to \"stones\", we would want these words to be considered the same across the document. This idea might be extremely relevant with regards to sentence rules, where the first letter at the start of a sentence must be capitalized. "

    "Assume you're preparing your lines and you realize that some of them do not truly represent what your character would say. You want to replace some of the wording in those lines for other terms your character is likely to say. However, the same issue arises where the lack of preparation time leads to not knowing what the best replacement could be. Then you remeber you can use the existing text to predict the next words that your character might say given a starting phrase / word. Markov chains are stochastic models used to represent probabilistic transitions between states. You can think of a markov chain similarly to a graph with nodes and edges. In a markov chain the nodes are the states and the edges are the transitions. Consider the following markov chain:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./pictures/graph.png\" alt=\"Markov chain shown as graph\" width=\"750\" height=\"750\">\n",
    "In this chain the states are \"aba\", \"baa\", \"bab\", and \"aab\". The transitions are indicated by through the edges. Some example include \"aba\" -> \"aba\", \"aba\" -> \"bab\", etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be applied in text mining for word prediction. An important characteristic of a Markov chain is that the future state is only dependent on the current state. This means that future states are not dependent upon the steps that led up to the current state. This can be represented through the conditional probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n",
    "$P(X_n = x | X_{n-1} = y_1, X_{n-2} = y_2, ...) = P(X_n = x | X_{n-1} = y)$\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a word (current state) and a document (used to determine word transitions), we can predict the next word using markov chains. More specifically, the n-gram Markov model predicts the next word in dependence on the previous n words.\n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand how Markov chains work let's understand the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume you are given the following documents and are attempting to predict the word that shoud come after 'like'\n",
    "* I like chocolate \n",
    "* I am Max\n",
    "* I like soccer\n",
    "* I like rock\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use a where each word represents a state.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I\" -> \"like\" -> \"chocolate\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I\" -> \"am\" -> \"Max\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I\" -> \"like\" -> \"soccer\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I\" -> \"like\" -> \"rock\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we only care about the current state we can write out the possibilities for each potential state.\n",

    "<img src=\"./pictures/Markov.png\" alt=\"Markov chain sequence\" width=\"750\" height=\"750\">\n",
